## 2 想买的电器 (感觉还是要调整)
### QuestionDescribe an electronic machine you want to buy.1. What it is2. When you know this machine3. What specific features you wantExplain why you want this machine.
### AnswerAn electronic machine I want to buy is cloth drier, which is used to remove the moisture to get warm and dry clothes after they are washed in a washing machine. 
Actually I knew this machine about 10 years ago when I was in college. I sent the bed linen and some clothes to the laundry room and got back them as dry and clean, without having to hang up them on the cloths lines. 
This machine is very useful in Hangzhou for it has 2 months rainy season during the late spring and early summer. It keeps raining. Therefor the washed clothes are hard to dry because of damp air and lack of sunshine. Even for the clean clothes, which are stored in the cupboard, has a strange smell after rainy season. So with the help of drier, it all works out. That’s why I want to buy this machine.

### QuestionDescribe a person you know who is good at cooking	Who this person is?
	What is your relationship with this person?
	What kinds of food he or she cooks?
And explain why you think this person is so good at cooking### Answer
My mother's aunty is very good at cooking. She is about 60 years old now and actually she was a doctor before she retired. But I think she cooks better than many professional cook in big restaurants. 

All the food she likes cook are normal Chinese food especially home dishes, such as vegetables, twice-cooked pork slices, chickens. She is just the good cook who can make delicious dishes with ordinary materials.

When I was 17 years old, I was hospitalized for about one month because of illness. During that period, I was very weak and had no appetite for food except for the dishes she cooked for me. So I recovered very soon due to her help. Twice-cooked pork slices she cooked is still my favorite until now.

I think she cooks well because she knows how to use the materials correcly and control the degree of heating very well. Besides that, as she was a doctor before, she knows how to keep nutrition together with the taste as well. That's why all family members like the food she cooked.## 4 名人

### Question	A small and successful company 	1. What is the company called?2. How did you know this company?3. What kind of business this company does? Explain why you think this company is successful."### AnswerA small and successful company I’d like to talk about is WhatsApp, a well-knowned Internet Company. There were less than 60 employees in this company last year.
I knew this company because of the news that Facebook acquired the company last February. It cost about 16 billion dollars for Facebook to takeover it which means about 300 million per employee. Can you imagine that ?
Actually the only product that this company has is WhatsAPP messenger. It is a cross-platform mobile messaging application, which allows people to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS. There is no advertisement in this product, which is totoally different with other Mobile Internet Products. Over 1 billion people have installed this APP and used this service in the past few years. So the company deserves what it got. It was considered as another Facebook before it was taken over.
With the great success, this company kind of becomes an idol for many startup companies all over the world.
## 6 穿着时髦的人(Done)
### QuestionA person you know who dresses well/fashionable.1. Who this person is.2. What kinds of clothes this person likes to wear3. How you know this person.4. Why you think this person dresses well.### AnswerI want to talk about my English teacher Ms. Zhang who is definitely the most fashionable person I’ve ever known. She is a middle-aged, graceful lady with good manners. She always wears lovely dresses as she believes that elegant appearance shows respect to others.
Ms. Zhang prefers to dresses and skirts especially. Even in a harsh winter, she would wear a skirt rather than heavy trousers. She always puts on different dresses every day so I can hardly tell how many dresses she has. Girls in my class discuss about her dresses all the time and admire her fashion taste. 
And when I talk about her fashion taste, it doesn’t mean she follows the mainstream to wear exactly the same as others. Instead she has her own style, elegant and graceful. In my opinion, fashion is a way to express oneself and Ms. Zhang made it. That’s why I think she is fashionable. And I think that’s why she is so charming and unforgettable.##  7当地好的改变 (Done)### QuestionA change that will improve your local area1. What the change is2.How the change works3. What kinds of problems the change will solve?4. How you feel about the change
### AnswerThe change that will improve my local area is there is going to be a public kindergarten near our neighborhood in this September. That means the children in my community could go to school within a walking distance. I confirmed this with the administrator of this kindergarten last month and I am really excited about this change because my baby girl is going to pre-school class this year.
(I live in the Sandun Town in Hangzhou. It has enjoyed a fast development in the past few years, which attracts lots of people moving into the new neighborhood there. However fundamental infrastructures, especially education resources are not followed up to the increasing population.) Currently most of the children in my neighborhood go to a kindergarten, which is about 5 km away from home. As you know, most of the children are taken care of by their grandparents, who don’t know how to drive. It is very inconvenient for them to come back and forth from school and home with their babies especially on the rainy or snowy days. 
I used to concern about the pick-ups for my baby girl. Now it all works out. So it is such a great piece of news for me and many other parents.

•        What it was
•        Who you gave it to
•        How you chose it
•        And explain why you spent along time on choosing it.

### Sample Answer 1
考虑给父母的礼物？
I gave many gifts in my life, to family members, to friends and even to my girlfriend. But among which I do have one special gift that took me a long time to choose. It’s painting with a beautiful frame which I gave to my best friend in the U.S.A.
We met each other 3 years ago in a school event and it was an exchange program. After a couple of days’ ice-breaking, we befriended with each other since we have a lot in common and enjoyed a good time together. When he/she left he/she gave me a bear toy with a bowknot on its neck which is really special and refine. With a letter saying a lot of friendly and touching words written by different color pens. You know, that was the first gift that I received from a foreign friend, plus it was really lovely and adorable, I was really exhilarated and gracious. So I decided to give him/ her a gift in return and sent it to his/her address in the states.
I have to say, choosing a proper gift for an American friend was really a headache task. I would like to choose something that is combined with a lot of Chinese elements and traditions. But I don’t really feel like to buy that sort of stuff cuz I think those could be found everywhere. Back then I knew a friend who is a painter and did a lot of cute board paintings which was stylish and cool. I like those painting a lot cuz they are all small paintings but represent for a profound idea and concept of life and love. But it was really hard to choose one particular painting among all so it truly took me some time. Finally I choose a smiling face of a young girl. It is kinda like cartoon but a bit abstract. The reason why I wanna give this to my friend is because I want him/her always remember my smile and hope he/she will always wear a smile on face too. After I’ve chosen the painting, it also took me some time to pick up a suitable frame for it. I picked up a green one for it cuz I thought green means nascence and vigor. 
He/she sent me a letter to thank me after he/she had received it. He said he really loves it and it’s special. More importantly, he said it always reminds him of our great friendship and to look at the brighter side of life. 

## 10 和朋友有分歧
### QuestionA time that you and your friend had a disagreementWhen this happened?2. Who you disagreed with.3. What you and your friends argued about4. If you two solved the disagreement in the end### Answer    Recently I had this disagreement with my best friend Juan over my diet plan.    Well, since I gave birth to my baby girl, I’d gained a lot of weight. I noticed that issue but I’d just ignored it. I believed that I had been in a good health for I slept well and had a great appetite. And I didn’t realize how worse it had gotten until I got my physical examination results last month, which said I had a mild fatty liver. So I was planning to lose weight.   I told my friend Juan I was planning on a diet to lose weight and asked her for some advice. Also, I told her that I was going to copy her diet, which included nothing but two potatoes for lunch and dinner. I really believed in this diet, because it helped her lose 5 kilos in two months. But, surprisingly she was strongly against it and she explained that it worked only in a short time but the weight would bounce if you couldn’t keep on to that diet. Besides, during the diet she constantly felt dizzy and was easy to catch cold. So after this discussion, I gave up on the diet and turned to seek for other effective and healthy ways like taking exercise regularly and having a balanced diet.I am grateful to Juan who talked me out of my silly ideas because she really cared about me instead of encouraging my bad plans. And I guess that’s what a truly good friend is.
### Answer 2 
Ok, well in all honesty, I don’t really have that many disagreements with my friends, because we all get on really well with each other, and you know, we hardly ever argue about stuff, but one time that I do remember was when I had a small disagreement with a friend over whether to take a taxi or subway to the train station.
 
And uh… I suppose it happened roughly two or three weeks ago. So it was pretty recently, and basically the situation was that I was with a friend of mine having dinner in a restaurant somewhere in the city centre, and we needed to catch a train later that evening from Hongqiao Station, which is in the outskirts of the city.
 
And my preference was to take the subway there, because I just thought it would be more reliable, and I didn’t wanna have to worry about getting stuck in a traffic jam and missing the train! But my friend thought we should get a cab to the station, cos he didn’t want the hassle of going to the subway station. He just thought it was too much effort.
 
So we kind of had a small argument about which one to take. And what happened in the end was that I basically gave in, and agreed to take the cab, because to be honest, I couldn’t really be bothered to argue over something so trivial like that for a long time! So yeah, we ended up taking a cab, and I’m glad to say that we did get to the station on time, but only just! So next time I think I’ll be a bit more adamant about taking the subway!
 
Phrases:
we all get on really well with each other – 我们都相处得非常好
we hardly ever argue about stuff － 我们几乎不吵架
basically the situation was that － 情况基本上就是
hassle - 麻烦
He just thought it was too much effort － 他只觉得太麻烦
I gave in －屈从；让步 If you give in, you agree to do something that you do not want to do.
I couldn’t really be bothered to argue over something so trivial like that for so long – 我不想费心思花很多时间为了那么小的事情吵架。
Bother (to do something) －操心；费力；麻烦 If you do not bother to do something or if you do not bother with it, you do not do it, consider it, or use it because you think it is unnecessary or because you are too lazy.
Trivial –琐碎的;不重要的;微不足道的 If you describe something as trivial, you think that it is unimportant and not serious. 
Adamant -坚决的;坚定不移的 If someone is adamant about something, they are determined not to change their mind about it.
 
Other useful phrases:
It wasn’t serious (or anything) – 不严重
We didn’t shout at each other (or anything like that)! – 我们并没有互相大喊大叫
We argued about something which was pretty mundane.
Mundane -普通的;平凡的;单调的 Something that is mundane is very ordinary and not at all interesting or unusual.
## 11 家庭照片A picture or photograph in your family1. What is in the picture2. Where this picture is in your home3. How this picture was taken4. Explain why you think this picture is meaningful
A photo in my family is a picture placed on my bedside table with a beautiful frame. It is a picture of my husband, Leo, who is on a boat and is surrounded by several wild monkeys. And one of the monkeys is taking food from Leo’s hand. You should see Leo’s face in the picture. He is so afraid of being attacked by those monkeys that he sits straightly and is too nervous to move. I took this picture when we had a boat trip in a rainforest in Malaysia last year. The guide stopped the boat in the river, where many wild monkeys stayed on the both sides of the river. As soon as Leo took out the food, the monkeys swam through the river and climbed onto our boat. They were not afraid of us at all, just took the food from Leo’s hands and bags. So I pushed the shutter and took that picture. It is meaningful to us because I guess it was the 1st time that Leo has a close contact with so many wild animals. ## 14 让你笑的小孩  (????????)A time that a child did something that made you laugh1. When this happened?2. Who the child was3. What the child did4. Explain why it was funny (But which impressed me most is the first time she called me MOM. It was 2 years ago when she was 9 months. Actually she had spoken her first word 3 months earlier than that. And I was frustrated because her first word is Dad. During that 3 months, my husband Leo liked to show off in front of me. Every time my baby girl called DAD, he always answered very loudly on purpose. Which is even worse, he laughed at me every time. Finally when she was 9 months old, she called me Mom for the 1st time. I was so excited that couldn’t help to laughing. )As a mom, I’d like to say that my 3 years old baby girl makes me laugh every day.She is 3 years old but she knew a lot and talks like an adult every day. Taking yesterday evening for example, I was reading books with her together while we were on the bed. Suddenly I heard a sound like “BU”. I knew that she passed gas and concerned about her pupu. So I asked if she wanted to go to the bathroom. She answered calmly: No, the gas is not the sign that I need to go to the bathroom, but it is the sign that my butts want to change a mood. I was burst into laugher when I heard this. She saw me keeping laughing, so smiled and talked to herself: I am so brilliant. I couldn’t forget the tune and the way of her expression. I just couldn’t help to keep laughing.Why it is so funny? I had never heard sb talking about the gas like this. I admired the children’s imagination. As an adult, you would never know what they are thinking about unless they told me.

### QuestionDescribe a person you know who can speak a second language
You should say
Who this person is
How you know them
What language they speak
And explain why you think this person can master this language
 
### Answer 
Ok right then, well there are actually quite a few people I know who can speak a second language well, but the person who stands out the most is one of my English friends called Nick, so he’s who I’m gonna talk about.
 
And uh, I got to know him at university, cos we’re on the same course, which is Modern Chinese. And um, I find it incredible just how quickly he’s managed to learn it!  Because he couldn’t actually speak a word of Chinese before the course began, you know, he started pretty much from scratch, and in the space of about two years, he can now speak it pretty fluently. It’s amazing!
 
Um…and as for how he’s been able to learnt it so well, uh.. I guess there a few reasons, one of which is that he always takes every opportunity to speak the language, you know, he’s never afraid of making mistakes or anything. So he’ll always try answering the questions in class, and he hangs out a lot with Chinese friends in his free time. Another thing is that he’s also got a very strong curiosity for the language, which I noticed once when I saw him reading a story by the writer Lu Xun. Because it wasn’t something that we had been told to read, you know, it was simply out of his interest in Chinese that he decided to read it, and that made me realize why he had become so good at the language.
 
And um…I’m just trying to think if there’s anything else to say…uh... oh yeah, I’ve also noticed that he listens really attentively to native speakers when he’s talking with them. You know, he’s not just focused on things that he’s trying to say. He’s also listening extremely carefully to people talking around him. And he picks up an incredible amount just by doing that. So yeah, I’d say these are probably the main reasons as to why he speaks the language so well, and I feel really lucky to have him as a friend, because I’ve been able to learn a lot from him!
 
Notes:
quite a few – quite a lot of
he started pretty much from scratch – 他差不多从零开始
in the space of… - 在… 期间内
he listens really attentively – 全神贯注地听
I’m just trying to think if there’s anything else to say – 我在想还有什么话可以说…
pick up –(不费力地）学会 If you pick up something such as a skill or an idea, you acquire it without effort over a period of time.
 
Other useful phrases:
She sounds exactly like a native speaker.
She can speak the language effortlessly.## 23 有教育意义的旅途
### Question
Describe an educational trip you took
You should say
Where you went
What you did there
Who you went there with
And explain why you thought this trip was educational
 
### Answer 
Ok then, well the educational trip that I’d like to talk to you about was the time I went to Taiwan, for a month, to attend a summer course. And the reason was that I was fortunate enough to have been awarded a scholarship to study there, so all the costs were covered, which was great!
 
Anyway, as for what I did there, well um, the mornings were basically taken up with classes, cos they were about four hours’ long, if I remember correctly. And after that, we had to do a lot of self-study, because we were given quite a bit of homework each day, you know, it was pretty intensive!
 
So yeah, I was, like, working by myself pretty much every afternoon, trying to get all my work done, and then in the evenings, I just chilled out with the other foreign students who were there studying. For example, we went out for dinner together most evenings, and then after that, we often went for a few drinks somewhere. So I basically had a really great time, and improved my Chinese in the process, I’m glad to say!
 
Anyway, finally, in terms of what I learnt, well firstly, I learnt a huge amount of Chinese, because as I mentioned earlier, the course was pretty intensive, so they crammed a lot into the one month. I mean, it was probably like half a year’s work on a normal programme! So it was pretty crazy! But you know, I’d say as a result, my understanding of the language increased significantly, so I feel super lucky that I was given the opportunity to go there. And as well as that, I also got to know more about the culture and history there, so all in all, it was an incredible experience and I learnt a great deal.
 
Notes:
the costs were covered – the costs were paid for
the mornings were basically taken up with classes – 上午基本上都是被上课占据
quite a bit – quite a lot
it was pretty intensive - 很强化的
pretty much every afternoon – 差不多每个下午
chilled out – relaxed
cram (sth) into… – 把(某某事)塞进去
all in all - 总而言之
I learnt a great deal – I learnt a lot## 24 早起的经历

### QuestionDescribe an occasion you got up extremely early.
You should say:
When this happened
What you needed to do that day
Who you were with
And explain how you felt about getting up so early on that day.
 
### Answer 
Ok then, well the time that I’m gonna talk to you about was when I had to get up super early to catch a flight to South Korea, because my flight was like, um … I can’t remember the exact time, but it was something like 6 or 7 in the morning, and I live about an hour away from the airport. And also bearing in mind that we had to check in at least an hour before take-off, I was up at about 4am, sometime around then. So for me, that’s, like, ridiculously early. I mean, most days, I’m normally up at around 7 o’clock-ish, so getting up at 4 was a pretty big change to the routine, as you can imagine! And I think I actually set two alarms just to make sure that I wouldn’t oversleep and miss the flight!
 
But strangely enough, it wasn’t as bad as I’d expected. You know, I think it’s probably because I was feeling so excited about travelling to South Korea. So um, I thought I would I feel mega tired, but I actually woke up before my alarms went off. It’s kind of funny how that often happens, you know, it’s as if your body knows what time you’ve got to get up, and so you end up waking up by yourself, completely naturally, just before your alarm’s about to go off!
 
And um, if I remember correctly, I actually woke up several times in the night thinking it was time to get up. I was that excited! So when I did get up, I wasn’t really feeling that tired at all, cos I was so looking forward to the trip. And it was also quite a nice feeling getting up before dawn because it was really quiet and peaceful, and the roads were virtually empty, which made a nice change! So we got to the airport with quite a lot of time to spare, and even had time for a bit of breakfast before we boarded the plane.
 
So yeah, that’s about it then. Thanks for listening.
 
Notes:
bearing in mind – considering (考虑到)
ridiculously -可笑地，荒谬地
7 o’clock-ish – 7点左右；(用于表示时间、日期、年龄的词之后)表示“…前后的”，“…左右的” -ish is added to words referring to times, dates, or ages to form words which indicate that the time or age mentioned is approximate.
set two alarms – 定闹钟
strangely enough - 说来也怪, 说来也怪
mega tired – really tired （置于形容词和副词前，表示强调） Young people sometimes use mega in front of adjectives or adverbs in order to emphasize them.
alarms went off – 闹钟响了

we made the flight - 我们赶上了飞机## 30 儿时的幸福家事
### Question
Describe a happy event from your childhood that you remember well.
You should say:
What the event was
When and where it happened
What you saw or did
And explain why you remember this event so well
 
### Answer 
Ok right then, well after a bit of thought, the family event that I’d like to talk to you about was the wedding of one of my aunts. And I guess the reason I remember it so well is because it was the first wedding I’d ever been to, so it left quite a lasting impression on me. And I was really young at the time, you know, I was only about 5 or 6, so I guess I must have been one of the youngest people there.
 
And uh, the wedding took place in some restaurant in our hometown. I can’t tell you the exact name of the place cos I honestly can’t remember, but what I can tell you is that it was a pretty big place, because I mean, there must have been at least a couple of hundred people there.
 
And as for what happened, well it was basically just a typical wedding party, you know, with loads of food and drink, although unfortunately I was too young to be able to enjoy all the wine and champagne on offer!  But at least I got to enjoy all the food, which there was absolutely masses of! And another thing I remember quite clearly was playing around with the microphone, and saying a few words into it. You know, I’d never seen a microphone before, so it felt pretty cool speaking into it and hearing my voice come out through the speakers.
 
And uh… yeah, there’s not really that much more to say about it! So… thanks for listening! 
 
Notes:
it left quite a lasting impression on me -留下了难忘的印象
I must have been one of the youngest people there – 我应该是最小的人之一
in some restaurant – 在某个饭店
there must have been at least a couple of hundred people there – 应该有至少两百人再那里了
typical – 典型的
loads of – lots of
I got to enjoy… – I could enjoy, 我可以享受…
there was absolutely masses of food – 有好多好多吃的！
the speakers  - 音响
There’s not really that much more to say about it! – 基本上没有别的话可说了
 
Other phrases:
It was a really fun day, and because I was one of the youngest people there, I got a lot of attention, and everyone was really nice to me.
 
So yeah, all in all it was a pretty cool day!
 
I remember that day I was, like, dressed up in a suit, which was the first time in my life I think I had been dressed so smartly! So that also made the occasion feel a little bit extra special, if you know what I mean!

## 43 特别的建筑
### Question
Describe an unusual building you’ve visited
You should say
Where it is
What it is used for
What it looks like
And explain why you think it is unusual
 
### Answer 
 
Ok right then, well the building I’ve decided to talk about is The Oriental Pearl Tower, at least I think that’s the name of it in English, cos um, I normally always call it by its Chinese name, which is 东方明珠.
 
Anyway, as for where it is, well it’s basically right in the middle of Shanghai, on the Pudong side, but you can see it across from the river, and I think it’s probably fair to say that it’s the main focal point of the city. You know, you can’t really miss it!
 
And um, regarding what it’s actually used for, well I guess it was built primarily to act as a TV transmission tower, although it’s more of a tourist attraction now. I mean, that’s what people know it as really! And um, if you haven’t seen it before, it’s basically like, um, how can I put it? Um… it’s kind of just like a tall pointed tower with a load of balls stacked on top of each other, some bigger than others. So it’s actually pretty simple in design, but there’s something about it that makes it look really cool and unique. Oh and I also shouldn’t forget to mention that, at night, it’s lit up really well, and I think most people would agree that it actually looks quite a lot better at night than it does during the day. But anyway, um… what else is there to say about it? Uh… I suppose it also looks kind of futuristic in a way, you know, like something out of a sci-fi film! So yeah, it’s a really cool building.
 
And in terms of why I think it’s unusual, well I guess there’s not really any other building like it in the world, at least as far as I know! So it really kind of sticks in the memory once you’ve seen it. And as such, it’s become, like, the main landmark of Shanghai. So um, yeah, that’s pretty much all there is to say!
 
Notes:
right in the middle - 在正中 (“right” emphasizes that it’s in the very middle)
I think it’s (probably) fair to say that – 我觉得可以说
the main focal point -主要的焦点
it’s lit up at night - 晚上亮起来
what else is there to say about it – 还有什么话可以说呢？

Ok right then, well after thinking for a bit just now, I’d say the family member I’d most like to work with is my younger brother, for reasons I’ll come to shortly.
 
But firstly, I’d like to tell you a little bit about him as a person, and I guess probably the best word to describe him would be sociable, because you know, he just loves being around people and making friends. And um.. what else?.... Um…yeah, I’d basically just describe him as being very outgoing, super friendly, and uh… extremely likeable. For example, I mean, he always seems to be in a good mood, and I guess it’s because he has a positive outlook on life. You know, he always sees the good side of things, and that’s kind of what makes him fun to be with.
 
So yeah, that’s basically his general personality, and in terms of why I’d like to work with him, well, simply speaking, I think we would complement each other quite well. Because um, firstly, he’s much more of a businessman than me. You know, I have no idea about how to run a company, whereas he studied business at university and has much more of a business mind than I do. So that’s one thing, and uh, secondly, I think he would be very good at making contacts and finding new clients, while I would be more suited to staying in the office and doing the nitty-gritty work for them, like writing reports and stuff.
 
So um, yeah, I think we would make a pretty good team, and although we haven’t worked together before in a business context, I think we understand each other well enough that we could succeed pretty well together.
