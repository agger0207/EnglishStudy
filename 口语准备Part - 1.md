Interlaken 雪朗峰 (Schilthorn)

Let me tell you about a beautiful Town named Interlaken at the foot of Alps Mountain. It is in the middle of Switchland and I went there in 2011, together with three other colleagues from Germany as I just travelled to Germany for business. This towned is named as it is in the middle of two beautiful lakes, LakeThun and LakeBrienz. And it is well-knowned as 


Let me tell you about the Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park which is located near the city of Zhangye in China’s northwestern Gansu province. This place is well-known for its breathtaking colours of the rocks, which are very smooth, sharp and very tall. I went there four years ago to travel around to visit the numeric historical relics with my girlfriend in the bumpy and dusty area of Hexi Corridor.

When I got there that day, I hiked along the board way in the mountainous area in the sunny morning and stayed there for the whole day. What was really amazing was that the colours of the mountains changed continuously with the light of the day, showing yellow and red layers covered by a light grey layer. Standing in the viewing platform, I could enjoy the pictures of painted colours of endless mountains, especially during the sunset, and took loads of pictures there.

The unusual colours of the rocks were formed by the erosion of red sandstone, which made the rock layers appear in different colours, textures and size. I was really stunned by the power of nature.

## 2 想买的电器 (Done)
### QuestionDescribe an electronic machine you want to buy.1. What it is2. When you know this machine3. What specific features you wantExplain why you want this machine.
### AnswerAn electronic machine I want to buy is cloth drier, which is used to remove the moisture to get warm and dry clothes after they are washed in a washing machine. 
Actually I knew this machine about 10 years ago when I was in college. I sent the bed linen and some clothes to the laundry room and got back them as dry and clean, without having to hang up them on the cloths lines. 
This machine is very useful in Hangzhou for it has 2 months rainy season during the late spring and early summer. It keeps raining. Therefor the washed clothes are hard to dry because of damp air and lack of sunshine. Even for the clean clothes, which are stored in the cupboard, has a strange smell after rainy season. So with the help of drier, it all works out. By the way, such machine is always helpful in winter as it is almost cold and wet. That’s why I want to buy this machine.

### QuestionDescribe a person you know who is good at cooking	Who this person is?
	What is your relationship with this person?
	What kinds of food he or she cooks?
And explain why you think this person is so good at cooking### Answer
My mother's aunty is very good at cooking. She is about 60 years old now and actually she was a doctor before she retired. But I think she cooks better than many professional cook in big restaurants. 

All the food she likes cook are normal Chinese food especially home dishes, such as vegetables, twice-cooked pork slices, chickens. She is just the good cook who can make delicious dishes with ordinary materials.

When I was 17 years old, I was hospitalized for about one month because of illness. During that period, I was very weak and had no appetite for food except for the dishes she cooked for me. So I recovered very soon due to her help. Twice-cooked pork slices she cooked is still my favorite until now.

I think she cooks well because she knows how to use the materials correcly and control the degree of heating very well. Besides that, as she was a doctor before, she knows how to keep nutrition together with the taste as well. That's why all family members like the food she cooked.## 4 喜欢的名人（Done）

He is about fifty years old, short and slim. I assume he has been well known all over the world since the IPO of Alibaba in New York last September.He is famous because he founded the Alibaba Group, a family of highly successful Internet-based businesses, which has brought a revolution in China. This company has changed people’s lifestyle in many ways. Such as shopping habits, paying methods, investment concept.

### Question	A small and successful company 	1. What is the company called?2. How did you know this company?3. What kind of business this company does? Explain why you think this company is successful."### AnswerA small and successful company I’d like to talk about is WhatsApp, a well-knowned Internet Company. There were less than 60 employees in this company last year.
I knew this company because of the news that Facebook acquired the company last February. It cost about 16 billion dollars for Facebook to takeover it which means about 300 million per employee. Can you imagine that? Even some chinese internet companies have said valuations are too high.
Actually the only product that this company has is WhatsAPP messenger. It is a cross-platform mobile messaging application, which allows people to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS. There is no advertisement in this product, which is totoally different with other Mobile Internet Products. Over 1 billion people have installed this APP and used this service in the past few years. So the company deserves what it got. It was considered as another Facebook before it was taken over.
With the great success, this company kind of becomes an idol for many startup companies all over the world.

## 6 穿着时髦的人(Done)
### QuestionA person you know who dresses well/fashionable.1. Who this person is.2. What kinds of clothes this person likes to wear3. How you know this person.4. Why you think this person dresses well.### AnswerI want to talk about my English teacher Ms. Zhang who is definitely the most fashionable person I’ve ever known. She is a middle-aged, graceful lady with good manners. She always wears lovely dresses as she believes that elegant appearance shows respect to others.
Ms. Zhang prefers to dresses and skirts especially. Even in a harsh winter, she would wear a skirt rather than heavy trousers. She always puts on different dresses every day so I can hardly tell how many dresses she has. Girls in my class discuss about her dresses all the time and admire her fashion taste. 
And when I talk about her fashion taste, it doesn’t mean she follows the mainstream to wear exactly the same as others. Instead she has her own style, elegant and graceful. In my opinion, fashion is a way to express oneself and Ms. Zhang made it. That’s why I think she is fashionable. And I think that’s why she is so charming and unforgettable.##  7当地好的改变 (Done)### QuestionA change that will improve your local area1. What the change is2.How the change works3. What kinds of problems the change will solve?4. How you feel about the change
### AnswerThe change that will improve my local area is there is going to be a public kindergarten near our neighborhood in this September. That means the children in my community could go to school within a walking distance. I confirmed this with the administrator of this kindergarten last month and I am really excited about this change because my baby girl is going to pre-school class this year.
(I live in the Sandun Town in Hangzhou. It has enjoyed a fast development in the past few years, which attracts lots of people moving into the new neighborhood there. However fundamental infrastructures, especially education resources are not followed up to the increasing population.) Currently most of the children in my neighborhood go to a kindergarten, which is about 5 km away from home. As you know, most of the children are taken care of by their grandparents, who don’t know how to drive. It is very inconvenient for them to come back and forth from school and home with their babies especially on the rainy or snowy days. 
I used to concern about the pick-ups for my baby girl. Now it all works out. So it is such a great piece of news for me and many other parents.

### Answer
Describe a gift for others that took you long time to choose.
•        What it was
•        Who you gave it to
•        How you chose it
•        And explain why you spent along time on choosing it.

### Sample Answer 1
考虑给父母的礼物？
I gave many gifts in my life, to family members, to friends and even to my girlfriend. But among which I do have one special gift that took me a long time to choose. It’s painting with a beautiful frame which I gave to my best friend in the U.S.A.
We met each other 3 years ago in a school event and it was an exchange program. After a couple of days’ ice-breaking, we befriended with each other since we have a lot in common and enjoyed a good time together. When he/she left he/she gave me a bear toy with a bowknot on its neck which is really special and refine. With a letter saying a lot of friendly and touching words written by different color pens. You know, that was the first gift that I received from a foreign friend, plus it was really lovely and adorable, I was really exhilarated and gracious. So I decided to give him/ her a gift in return and sent it to his/her address in the states.
I have to say, choosing a proper gift for an American friend was really a headache task. I would like to choose something that is combined with a lot of Chinese elements and traditions. But I don’t really feel like to buy that sort of stuff cuz I think those could be found everywhere. Back then I knew a friend who is a painter and did a lot of cute board paintings which was stylish and cool. I like those painting a lot cuz they are all small paintings but represent for a profound idea and concept of life and love. But it was really hard to choose one particular painting among all so it truly took me some time. Finally I choose a smiling face of a young girl. It is kinda like cartoon but a bit abstract. The reason why I wanna give this to my friend is because I want him/her always remember my smile and hope he/she will always wear a smile on face too. After I’ve chosen the painting, it also took me some time to pick up a suitable frame for it. I picked up a green one for it cuz I thought green means nascence and vigor. 
He/she sent me a letter to thank me after he/she had received it. He said he really loves it and it’s special. More importantly, he said it always reminds him of our great friendship and to look at the brighter side of life. 

## 10 和朋友有分歧(未完成) (可以编利物浦的故事)
### QuestionA time that you and your friend had a disagreementWhen this happened?2. Who you disagreed with.3. What you and your friends argued about4. If you two solved the disagreement in the end### Answer    Recently I had this disagreement with my best friend Juan over my diet plan.    Well, since I gave birth to my baby girl, I’d gained a lot of weight. I noticed that issue but I’d just ignored it. I believed that I had been in a good health for I slept well and had a great appetite. And I didn’t realize how worse it had gotten until I got my physical examination results last month, which said I had a mild fatty liver. So I was planning to lose weight.   I told my friend Juan I was planning on a diet to lose weight and asked her for some advice. Also, I told her that I was going to copy her diet, which included nothing but two potatoes for lunch and dinner. I really believed in this diet, because it helped her lose 5 kilos in two months. But, surprisingly she was strongly against it and she explained that it worked only in a short time but the weight would bounce if you couldn’t keep on to that diet. Besides, during the diet she constantly felt dizzy and was easy to catch cold. So after this discussion, I gave up on the diet and turned to seek for other effective and healthy ways like taking exercise regularly and having a balanced diet.I am grateful to Juan who talked me out of my silly ideas because she really cared about me instead of encouraging my bad plans. And I guess that’s what a truly good friend is.
### Answer 2 
Ok, well in all honesty, I don’t really have that many disagreements with my friends, because we all get on really well with each other, and you know, we hardly ever argue about stuff, but one time that I do remember was when I had a small disagreement with a friend over whether to take a taxi or subway to the train station.
 
And uh… I suppose it happened roughly two or three weeks ago. So it was pretty recently, and basically the situation was that I was with a friend of mine having dinner in a restaurant somewhere in the city centre, and we needed to catch a train later that evening from Hongqiao Station, which is in the outskirts of the city.
 
And my preference was to take the subway there, because I just thought it would be more reliable, and I didn’t wanna have to worry about getting stuck in a traffic jam and missing the train! But my friend thought we should get a cab to the station, cos he didn’t want the hassle of going to the subway station. He just thought it was too much effort.
 
So we kind of had a small argument about which one to take. And what happened in the end was that I basically gave in, and agreed to take the cab, because to be honest, I couldn’t really be bothered to argue over something so trivial like that for a long time! So yeah, we ended up taking a cab, and I’m glad to say that we did get to the station on time, but only just! So next time I think I’ll be a bit more adamant about taking the subway!

we all get on really well with each other – 我们都相处得非常好
we hardly ever argue about stuff － 我们几乎不吵架

Bother (to do something) －操心；费力；麻烦 If you do not bother to do something or if you do not bother with it, you do not do it, consider it, or use it because you think it is unnecessary or because you are too lazy.
Trivial –琐碎的;不重要的;微不足道的 If you describe something as trivial, you think that it is unimportant and not serious. 
Adamant -坚决的;坚定不移的 If someone is adamant about something, they are determined not to change their mind about it.
 
Other useful phrases:
It wasn’t serious (or anything) – 不严重

## 11 家庭照片 (Done)A picture or photograph in your family1. What is in the picture2. Where this picture is in your home3. How this picture was taken4. Explain why you think this picture is meaningful
A photo in my family is a picture placed on my bedside table with a beautiful frame. It is a picture of my wife, Cindy, who is on a boat and is surrounded by several wild monkeys. And one of the monkeys is taking food from her hand. You should see her face in the picture. She is so afraid of being attacked by those monkeys that she sits straightly and is too nervous to move. I took this picture when we had a boat trip in a rainforest in Malaysia last year. The guide stopped the boat in the river, where many wild monkeys stayed on the both sides of the river. As soon as my wife took out the food, the monkeys swam through the river and climbed onto our boat. They were not afraid of us at all, just took the food from our hands and bags. So I pushed the shutter and took that picture. It is meaningful to us because I guess it was the 1st time that Cindy has a close contact with so many wild animals. The other important reason is that it is really a good memory of our first overseas tourism.## 12 看书写字的地方 (图书馆，和8一样)

Explain why it was funny (But which impressed me most is the first time she called me MOM. It was 2 years ago when she was 9 months. Actually she had spoken her first word 3 months earlier than that. And I was frustrated because her first word is Dad. During that 3 months, my husband Leo liked to show off in front of me. Every time my baby girl called DAD, he always answered very loudly on purpose. Which is even worse, he laughed at me every time. Finally when she was 9 months old, she called me Mom for the 1st time. I was so excited that couldn’t help to laughing. )As a mom, I’d like to say that my 3 years old baby girl makes me laugh every day.She is 3 years old but she knew a lot and talks like an adult every day. Taking yesterday evening for example, I was reading books with her together while we were on the bed. Suddenly I heard a sound like “BU”. I knew that she passed gas and concerned about her pupu. So I asked if she wanted to go to the bathroom. She answered calmly: No, the gas is not the sign that I need to go to the bathroom, but it is the sign that my butts want to change a mood. I was burst into laugher when I heard this. She saw me keeping laughing, so smiled and talked to herself: I am so brilliant. I couldn’t forget the tune and the way of her expression. I just couldn’t help to keep laughing.Why it is so funny? I had never heard sb talking about the gas like this. I admired the children’s imagination. As an adult, you would never know what they are thinking about unless they told me.
## 15 擅长外语的人
### QuestionDescribe a person you know who can speak a second language
You should say
Who this person is
How you know them
What language they speak
And explain why you think this person can master this language
 
### Answer 
Ok right then, well there are actually quite a few people I know who can speak a second language well, but the person who stands out the most is one of my English friends called Nick, so he’s who I’m gonna talk about.
 
And uh, I got to know him at university, cos we’re on the same course, which is Modern Chinese. And um, I find it incredible just how quickly he’s managed to learn it!  Because he couldn’t actually speak a word of Chinese before the course began, you know, he started pretty much from scratch, and in the space of about two years, he can now speak it pretty fluently. It’s amazing!
 
Um…and as for how he’s been able to learnt it so well, uh.. I guess there a few reasons, one of which is that he always takes every opportunity to speak the language, you know, he’s never afraid of making mistakes or anything. So he’ll always try answering the questions in class, and he hangs out a lot with Chinese friends in his free time. Another thing is that he’s also got a very strong curiosity for the language, which I noticed once when I saw him reading a story by the writer Lu Xun. Because it wasn’t something that we had been told to read, you know, it was simply out of his interest in Chinese that he decided to read it, and that made me realize why he had become so good at the language.
 
And um…I’m just trying to think if there’s anything else to say…uh... oh yeah, I’ve also noticed that he listens really attentively to native speakers when he’s talking with them. You know, he’s not just focused on things that he’s trying to say. He’s also listening extremely carefully to people talking around him. And he picks up an incredible amount just by doing that. So yeah, I’d say these are probably the main reasons as to why he speaks the language so well, and I feel really lucky to have him as a friend, because I’ve been able to learn a lot from him!
 
Notes:
quite a few – quite a lot of
he started pretty much from scratch – 他差不多从零开始
in the space of… - 在… 期间内
he listens really attentively – 全神贯注地听
I’m just trying to think if there’s anything else to say – 我在想还有什么话可以说…
pick up –(不费力地）学会 If you pick up something such as a skill or an idea, you acquire it without effort over a period of time.
 
Other useful phrases:
She sounds exactly like a native speaker.
She can speak the language effortlessly.

### Question
Describe an indoor game (not about sport) you liked to play when you were a child（事件类）
You should say:
What the game was
Who you used to play with
How you played it
And explain why you liked this game 
 
### Answer 1 
 Speaking of a game I loved when I was a kid, I would definitely say it is hide and seek. It’s the easiest but the most thrilling game ever.
 
 I remember I always did this game with my bosom buddies, mostly 6 to 10 close friends.
 
First we would choose a member to be the seeker, then the rest had to find places to hide themselves. After the seeker finished counting from 1 to 10, he or she would open the eyes and try his or her best to find us. The first guy getting caught would be the next seeker.
 
 I remember once I hid in my mother’s closet and fell asleep. It’s my mother who finally discovered my secret location, which was really amusing when I think of it now. All of kids like me love this game a lot coz it’s a great way to kill the time and let off steam. Plus, it could enhance our friendships. Most importantly, it could involve in quite a number of kids at a time and we didn’t need any equipment. All we need to do is to find a secret location and hide ourselves safely.
 
### Answer 2
Erm…actually, when I was young, I played Mahjong pretty much and I did very well. So I'd like to tell you something about it. When I was young I lived with grandma. She's crazy about playing the game, and she even taught me how to play it, and that's why I knew and played the game when I was young. But now I'm kind of busy with my studies, so I haven't played the game for ages. Anyways, the game is like this: there is a table in the middle, at which four players sit in a square. The four players get 13 tiles each at first, and then draw and discard tiles till anyone of them who forms 4 groups and a pair with 14 tiles. Who gets that first, who wins. It sounds simple, but can be very hard when you play. On top of that, it's just a simple description of the game, and actually the rules of the game can be various in different areas and some of them can be very complicated. Of course, the game sometimes seems to be a test of your luck, even if you are very skillful. In fact, I love the game pretty much. For one thing, the game is very interesting and it's a good way to relax and kill time for a big family or gathering. For another, it helps with your intelligence and cognition, at least I think so. When discarding tiles you gotta think about the tiles of the other three players, guess what they need and what they don't, accompanied by a really good understanding of the rules, coz' you don't wanna make a trouble with the tile you discard, right?

Vocabulary

be crazy about doing sth.

be busy with sth.

on top of sth.

seem to be sth.

### Question
Describe something that you want to learn more.
•What is it?
•Why you want to learn it?
•How to learn it?
and explain why you want to keep learning it.

### Answer

Functional Programming language.

例子:

I want to learn more about the outside world when I’m financially and mentally ready.
 
I am an self-claimed armchair traveler, I can be unbelievably talkative when it comes to the exotic cultures, since I invest a big chunk of my spare time online to seek knowledge and experience about the world I never has a chance to set foot on, so the nod acquaintances regard me a well-traveled cosmopolitan, but guys that really know me call me a hopeless indoorsman. For a long time, I feel 100 percent OK with my life style, until one day, I realise the “well-rounder” reputation I enjoy is nothing but a mask, only to conceal the real coward and weak me. Others life stores, no matter how I can internalise, are others, not mine. I want to really sample the world with my own eyes, ears and limbs. 
 
The great way to learn the world is traveling, preferably in a self-help style. That’s what I want and plan. I know everyone once had a dream like going around to see the world, and in most case it’s just a sweet and unrealistic one never treated seriously. But this time I mean it. People say, when you are young, you’re stopped from traveling the world by lack of money, while when you are not young and supposedly not short of money, by lack of courage. I think for now I am in lack of both, but my urge is more and more intense of leave everything behind and traveling the world by bicycle. In my plan, it will not a journey made up of famous tourist resorts. I will get down to the local culture and truly live and feel it. The joy and sorrows of real people, the foods and views of the local, I desire a first-hand contact of all of those. I will do part-time jobs, collect stories and make friends all along the way.
 
A great solo traveler said: I'm yet to meet anyone who regrets travelling, if you have the opportunity and inclination, grab it with both hands. I am waiting for that opportunity.

4有关travel的观点
（旅行的限制因素）Unfortunately, the limiting factor is always money. Whatever lifehack we could learn from others for shaving the cost of travel, it's still a hefty block of cash to put out.
 
（旅行是一所名牌大学）Your approach should be to look at travel as an investment for your life. Trust me, it can be worthier than the most prestigious of college degrees. I have one myself and I value my travel experience equally if not more. 
 
（值不值得）The big question you usually face is, do you get anything worthwhile out of travelling for such a long time? And the end of the day, you visit a handful of places, listen to some stories and make some new friends. But is this really worth all the time and money?
 
（一词以蔽之perspective）Travel gives you just one learning. Nothing more. Travel gives you perspective. Perspective for life. A guiding hand for the rest of your life.
 
（你所能得）Travel makes you realize we are all similar no matter what race, colour, language or country. Travel amplifies our learning. Travel makes you a master story teller. You will be able to weave the most convincing of stories
 
（信任的一跳a leap of faith） The biggest barrier to get over is fear.  If I had time to plan and think about quitting my job and taking time off like that, I don't know if I ever would have left!  You need that leap of faith and ability to ignore friends and family (and that inner voice) that says you shouldn't do this or it's irresponsible or childish.  
 
（马克吐温）Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

### Answer
百家讲坛 王立群

例子：
This topic just reminded me of a TV program named “in the office”, which is actually an English-teaching program made by the local TV chanel in my city. This program aims at teaching English in an interesting way. In that program, there is a small company named ITO, and each episide of the program shows a funny story that happens to the five employees in that company. The five employees talk both in Chinese and in English, and while they are talking, some special expressions from their remarks will be shown on the screen.
 
This program is shown every evening on the weekdays, and since I first came across it about half a year ago, I have been trying to watch it every day.
 
In terms of what I have learnt from it, I should say that I have learned some interesting expressions in English. For example, to “pull one’s legs” means to fool somebody, and…let me see… to “butter sb. Up” means to flatter somebody, right? Actually those idoms can not be taught by the textbooks which generally focus on formal and written English.
 
Finally, I am really fond of this program. For one thing, as I mentioned before, this program helps me to improve my English, especially spoken English; for another, there is always humour in this program, which makes it a good way for me to relax everyday after work.

### Answer 2
The Open University program, which is produced by BBC, has been aired for more than forty years. It is so successful that it set a good example for the other public educational programs. Many British people who don't have achance to study in a college have learned knowledge from this program. Because of this program, some of them are able to seek further education and get a college degree, which offers them more opportunities for better jobs. Moreover,the services have provided a competitive relationship with other media services agencies, leading to the increase in service quality of this industry. With thesupport of the UK government, BBC's programs grow so fast. They are able to produce independent educational programs without any influence from other forces. That is to say, they can broadcast the truth faithfully. It offers a chance for people to speak freely with a neutral, equitable and objective stand.## 23 有教育意义的旅途
### Question
Describe an educational trip you took
You should say
Where you went
What you did there
Who you went there with
And explain why you thought this trip was educational
 
### Answer 
Ok then, well the educational trip that I’d like to talk to you about was the time I went to Taiwan, for a month, to attend a summer course. And the reason was that I was fortunate enough to have been awarded a scholarship to study there, so all the costs were covered, which was great!
 
Anyway, as for what I did there, well um, the mornings were basically taken up with classes, cos they were about four hours’ long, if I remember correctly. And after that, we had to do a lot of self-study, because we were given quite a bit of homework each day, you know, it was pretty intensive!
 
So yeah, I was, like, working by myself pretty much every afternoon, trying to get all my work done, and then in the evenings, I just chilled out with the other foreign students who were there studying. For example, we went out for dinner together most evenings, and then after that, we often went for a few drinks somewhere. So I basically had a really great time, and improved my Chinese in the process, I’m glad to say!
 
Anyway, finally, in terms of what I learnt, well firstly, I learnt a huge amount of Chinese, because as I mentioned earlier, the course was pretty intensive, so they crammed a lot into the one month. I mean, it was probably like half a year’s work on a normal programme! So it was pretty crazy! But you know, I’d say as a result, my understanding of the language increased significantly, so I feel super lucky that I was given the opportunity to go there. And as well as that, I also got to know more about the culture and history there, so all in all, it was an incredible experience and I learnt a great deal.
 
Notes:
the costs were covered – the costs were paid for
the mornings were basically taken up with classes – 上午基本上都是被上课占据
quite a bit – quite a lot
it was pretty intensive - 很强化的
pretty much every afternoon – 差不多每个下午
chilled out – relaxed
cram (sth) into… – 把(某某事)塞进去
all in all - 总而言之
I learnt a great deal – I learnt a lot## 24 早起的经历

### QuestionDescribe an occasion you got up extremely early.
You should say:
When this happened
What you needed to do that day
Who you were with
And explain how you felt about getting up so early on that day.
 
### Answer 
Ok then, well the time that I’m gonna talk to you about was when I had to get up super early to catch a flight to South Korea, because my flight was like, um … I can’t remember the exact time, but it was something like 6 or 7 in the morning, and I live about an hour away from the airport. And also bearing in mind that we had to check in at least an hour before take-off, I was up at about 4am, sometime around then. So for me, that’s, like, ridiculously early. I mean, most days, I’m normally up at around 7 o’clock-ish, so getting up at 4 was a pretty big change to the routine, as you can imagine! And I think I actually set two alarms just to make sure that I wouldn’t oversleep and miss the flight!
 
But strangely enough, it wasn’t as bad as I’d expected. You know, I think it’s probably because I was feeling so excited about travelling to South Korea. So um, I thought I would I feel mega tired, but I actually woke up before my alarms went off. It’s kind of funny how that often happens, you know, it’s as if your body knows what time you’ve got to get up, and so you end up waking up by yourself, completely naturally, just before your alarm’s about to go off!
 
And um, if I remember correctly, I actually woke up several times in the night thinking it was time to get up. I was that excited! So when I did get up, I wasn’t really feeling that tired at all, cos I was so looking forward to the trip. And it was also quite a nice feeling getting up before dawn because it was really quiet and peaceful, and the roads were virtually empty, which made a nice change! So we got to the airport with quite a lot of time to spare, and even had time for a bit of breakfast before we boarded the plane.
 
So yeah, that’s about it then. Thanks for listening.

### Question
Describe something you do to (help you) stay healthy

What you do
When you start doing this
How much time you spend doing this/ how often you do it
And explain what benefits you get from this activity or how this activity helps you stay healthy

### Answer
A healthy body is the great beginning of a happy life. I am fully aware of this so I pay a lot of attention to my fitness and do exercises on a regular basis to stay healthy. Badminton is my favouriteamong all kinds of sports.
I learn to play badminton when I was a little child. In the countryside, the chilly weather is always a nightmare for me, since there was no heater in my house. Playing badminton turned out to be a good wayto dispel the cold. It was a routine of my family to play on cold winter day sunless it rained or snowed.
Though I grow up and am far away for my hometown now, I still keep up the habit of playing badminton. The difference is that I play badminton now to build up my body. I will play badminton on the court with my friends every weekend. Every time I will keep playing for an houror two without a single pause. At the beginning, I felt exhausted easily when I got home. My arms and legs continued aching for a couple of days. However, as practicegoes on, my body get fully adapted. All the negative reactions of my body were alleviated bit by bit and eventually gone for good.
Playing badminton now is a pure joy for me,bringing me resilience and flexibility.

### Question
 An exciting sport you know

Question
Describe an exciting sport you know. 
You should say: 
what the sport is; 
how you know about it; 
is it difficult? 
and explain why you think it is exciting.

### Answer
Football

I think tennis is the most exciting sport I ever know, it’s not because it really is a kind of extreme sport or super dangerous, it’s because it makes me really exciting and even drives me crazy. Tennis is a kind of sport that required good body condition and over-all physical quality, say like speed, power, observation, physical coordination and your eyes’ motion capture capability. I started training tennis since I was 8 and have played for already 16 years. My first tennis experience was really accidental. On my eight years old birthday, my aunty gave me a tennis racquet as a birthday gift which I wasn’t really into, but later I found this little gift began to have magic power on me. I still remember the scene when I first picked up the racquet and made my first hit against the wall. Watching the ball flying with a beautiful curve line and then it was rebounded by the wall and flew back to me,that was my very first hit with the racquet and ball, at that moment I knew and I told myself firmly, this is going to be my life-long endeavor. I don’t really think tennis is difficult, at least for me, maybe for many people it truly is, since I started to play tennis in such a young age, my body adapted to it gradually and my tennis level and improved accordingly too. Beyond the physically requirement, I think tennis also requires a high level of intelligence and mind power. When the two physically similar players playing against each other, the perseverance and strong will make a difference in win or loss. That’s what I think the most unpredictable part of tennis, meanwhile, it’s also the glamour of tennis. The reason why I think tennis is so exciting is because when I play tennis, I can feel the blood is burning in my vein and I can feel the passion. Even talk about tennis or watch games on TV I will became so bold and gallant. More importantly, throughout my years with tennis, I’ve always been on an uprising momentum and I think it’s where all these madness and confidence coming from.## 27 对讨厌的人友善

备考建议：这个话题的重点在为什么要对这个人友善上，因此选择素材时可以从这里作为突破口。例如在完成团队任务时，为了共同的目标而对不喜欢的人友善，或者朋友的朋友和你的关系不好，但碍于朋友的面子而对这个人客气，还有因为对某人存在偏见，随着对他的认识慢慢增加偏见消除，开始友好相待。
### QuestionA time you were friendly to someone you didn't like.1. When and where it happened2. Who he or she was3. Why you didn't like this person4. Explain why you were friendly to him or her on that occasion.### AnswerA time that I was friendly to a person I didn’t like was my first year in university.As a freshman in university, I was excited by everything I saw and also felt a little bit nervous about the new environment.   Then I got to know the new classmates and teachers. And Alice was one of the people who impressed me most at the first sight but not in a good way. She looked like a lovely sweet doll but dressed rather mature. The first time I met her was when she was late for class and she just broke into the classroom, passed by the teacher and took a seat at the first row without even feeling embarrassed. Then after a while she astonishingly slept with her head resting on the desk. I was shocked by her rudeness for I thought her behaviors showed no respect to the teacher at all. As she and I both tended to pick the front seats, we often sat together in the classroom and sometimes we had small talks at the break. Honestly I was not fond of her, but I still would like to be nice to her just out of courtesy. So I always kept her at a distance, not as a friend. But every time she kept talking all about her makeups and relationships barely asking about others. Honestly I was not fond of her, but I still would like to be nice to her just out of courtesy and that’s just all about us, no further.
