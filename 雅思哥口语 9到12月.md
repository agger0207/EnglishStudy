分娩也可以用delivery

As a father, I would like to talk about my waiting for my baby's birth in 25th, April 2012. My wife needs to do a c-section (剖腹产或者 caesarean，建议用c-section) as there was something wrong with her womb (wu:m). So I was still very nervous although the operation was arranged in the best hospital in Hangzhou. And of course, I was very excited and I could't wait to see my baby alouthgh I didn't know the baby's gender. The c-section started from about 2:30 pm and it was really a long wait for me. My mother in law and I waited outside the 
operation room and I couldn't sit down at all. I was walking up and down. I was excited because I was going to be a father. I'm very nervous and worried becasue my wife was some kind of high risk delivery women. Thanks God. My wife and daughter were pull outside the operation room at 4:09, lying on the bed and both healthy. It was really interesting and important experience for me and I was really very happy to wait at that time alghough I am not patient at all. And now I am waiting for my baby girl's grown up and in my opinion, it is another long and happy waiting. I really enjoy it.

Do you think patience is important ?

Yes, of course. Patience can help you to focus.
