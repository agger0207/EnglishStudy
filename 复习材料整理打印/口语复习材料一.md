## 11 家庭照片 (Done)(保留)A picture or photograph in your family1. What is in the picture2. Where this picture is in your home3. How this picture was taken4. Explain why you think this picture is meaningful
A photo in my family is a picture placed on my bedside table with a beautiful frame. It is a picture of my wife, Cindy, who is on a boat and is surrounded by several wild monkeys. And one of the monkeys is taking food from her hand. You should see her face in the picture. She is so afraid of being attacked by those monkeys that she sits straightly and is too nervous to move. I took this picture when we had a boat trip in a rainforest in Malaysia last year. The guide stopped the boat in the river, where many wild monkeys stayed on the both sides of the river. As soon as my wife took out the food, the monkeys swam through the river and climbed onto our boat. They were not afraid of us at all, just took the food from our hands and bags. So I pushed the shutter and took that picture. It is meaningful to us because I guess it was the 1st time that Cindy has a close contact with so many wild animals. The other important reason is that it is really a good memory of our first overseas tourism.

## 12 广告 (Done)
我想谈论的是一家主要做羊毛衫的商家在电视上做的广告，它的名字叫做恒源祥；最后一个字和汉字的羊其实很像。我很小的时候，也许还在读小学的时候，就从电视上见过他们的广告。我觉得他们的广告还是很简洁,很有特色,很容易让人们记住的，就是一个小羊出来，然后用很可爱的声音念出商家的名字，然后后面加上三个羊字。但是，让人没想到的是，在2008年的时候，这个广告升级了。你知道，羊是中国的12生肖之一，于是这个新广告将同样的广告词重复了12遍，仅仅是将后面的羊换成了其他的生肖比如虎或者龙之类的。我和我的小伙伴看到这个广告都惊呆了，这应该是我人生中见到的最难忘的广告了。但是坦白说，我相当不喜欢甚至是讨厌这个升级后的广告，虽然这能让人更好的记住，但是却毫无意义。

I want to talk about a television advertisement of a famous wool sweater merchant which name is called Heng Yuanxiang. The last word of of its name “Xiang” is very similar with the Chinese Character “yang” which means sheep and we all know the wool comes from the sheep. So there is a very famous and simple advertisement. A cute cartoon sheep just jumps out and says “Heng Yuanxiang, Yang Yang Yang”. I think it is a very successful advertisement. It is very easy to remember and it tells us that it mainly focus on the wool sweater because it is related with sheep. And it is very simple and lovely. When I was very young, maybe I was in primary school, I first saw them on TV and I just remembered it. However, in 2008, the advertising upgrade. You know, sheep is one of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs, so this new ad just repeated the same words 12 times, replacing sheep with other different zodiac signs such as tiger, monkey or something else. Can you imagine that ? 12 times. My friends and I were really shocked and some guys even thought maybe there was something wrong with the television. Frankly speaking, I don't like the upgraded advertisement at all although it could make people remember it better. It is really boring and doesn’t make any sense. I have to say that it is the worst advertisement I’ve ever seen. 

## 14 工作优秀的人 (Done)

可以结合以前的主题“有领导力的朋友”一起说。我想，还是说张立峰比较合适；比说Leon合适。

在我参加工作之后，我遇到过很多工作优秀的人，其中一个就是我今天想要讨论的人叫做张立峰，是我刚参加工作时的导师，同时也是我小组的leader。他比我大5岁，是一位杰出的软件工程师。首先，他的技术能力非常好，熟练掌握工作所需要的技能；然后，他非常善于解决分析问题，debug的能力和fix issues的能力很好，而且很善于总结经验；其次，我觉得他是一个非常友善的人，乐于帮助别人，尤其是指导刚刚参加工作的菜鸟，我觉得这也体现了他的领导才能。最后，学习能力也是非常重要的。因为在我们这行，技术发展太快；据我所知，他现在在一家创业公司从事着移动开发工作，这是他之前没有接触过的，但是他也做得非常好。


After I got to work, I met a lot of excellent  colleagues, one of whom I want to talk about today is Zhang Lifeng, who was my mentor and my team's leader during my first job. He is 5 years older than me and is an outstanding software engineer. First, he is very skilled and he has very good technical abilities. He is very good at solving problems, debugging and fix issues even if the issues are very hard to reproduce or analyze. He is also very good at summing up his experiences. Second, I think he is a very friendly person, willing to help others, especially to guide rookies. I got a lot of help from him and this character makes him a good leader. Finally, Learning new technology is easy for him. For software engineers, technology development is too fast so we need to keep learning. Having a splendid learning ability, he is competent for different areas of work. As far as I know, he is now working in a Startup Company, engaging in mobile development, which he didn’t know before. But he still do a quite good job as he studies so quickly.

## 21 借东西 (Done)

老实说，我很少向别人借东西，而且我也不太喜欢找别人借东西。不过就在上个月，我找我太太的妹妹借了一个笔记本。事情是这样的，我和我太太各有一个笔记本，然后我9月底需要到武汉去参加公司的校园招聘，非常不凑巧的是，其中一个笔记本由于长期不用，不知道为什么显示屏坏掉了，而另一台笔记本我太太工作中需要；不得已，我只能找我太太的妹妹借了一个快要被淘汰的笔记本，那台笔记本的性能比较糟糕，好在我只需要用来浏览网页，登陆公司的招聘系统，不需要额外做开发的工作，所以这个笔记本还是可以胜任的。当然，我用这个笔记本顺利的完成了自己的招聘工作。

Honestly, I rarely borrow something from others, as I normally buy the things by myself. But just in last month, I had to borrow a notebook from my sister-in-law as I need go to Wuhan by the end of September to participate in the company's campus recruitment. Actually my wife and I each have a laptop, but unfortunately the screen of my notebook is broken. It couldn’t display anything correctly. I guess it is because the laptop had been idled for a long time. You know, I only used computer when I was working in the company. Af first I wanted to take another laptop but my wife needed it for her job. Then I had to turn to my wife’s sister as she had a very old laptop which can still work with very poor performance. It was OK for me as I just need to browse the web, visit the company's recruitment system. There was no requirement for me to do additional development work during my business travel. Of course, the notebook was really helpful and  I used this notebook to finish my recruitment job successfully.

## 31 一首歌 (Done)

You'll never walk alone


Frankly / Honestly, I am not good at music  

老实说，我并不擅长音乐，而且我也不经常听歌。但确实有那么一首歌对我来说有点特别。这首歌名字叫做“You will never walk alone”，是利物浦足球俱乐部的队歌，而我正是利物浦俱乐部的忠实球迷。我第一次听这首歌是在2001年，那年利物浦俱乐部拿了5个冠军，是一个非常受欢迎的球队，那个时候我喜欢上了这只球队。我表哥和我说，你听过这个球队的队歌吗？于是我在他的推荐之下第一次听了这首歌并且喜欢上了这首歌。首先，它的旋律非常优美；然后它有很悠久的历史，我记得，披头士乐队也曾经演唱过这首歌。最重要的是，我觉得它表达了一个积极向上的精神。人生就像一段旅程；我们会遇到各种困难，各种风雨，但是我们遇到困难的时候不应该放弃，要记住，我们不是在独行，我们要勇敢前行，我们的朋友、家人会一直陪伴我们穿过暴风雨最终看到金色的天空，正如歌词中所唱到的那样。

Honestly, I'm not good at music, and I do not often listen to music. But it does have a song for me, a little bit special, which name is “You will never walk alone". Yeah, that’s right, I think you can guess that it is a very inspiring song from its name. It is the song of Liverpool Football Club and I am a loyal fan of Liverpool Football Club. I first heard this song in 2001，when Liverpool won five champions. The team was very popular at that time and I started to love this team just then. My cousin said: “Have you heard of the song of this team ? It is awesome”. So I heard this song under his recommendation and fell in love with this song. First, its melody is very beautiful. Second, there is a long history about this song. As I remember, the Beatles had also sung this song. Most importantly, I think it expresses a positive spirit. Life is like a journey. Sometimes we may feel alone when we suffer from life. It is like that you are walking lonely in the storm.  The song tells us to be brave and always keep hope in our heart. We should always remember that we are not walking alone during the journey of life. Our family and friends always stay with us. And With their encouragement and companionship, we can walk through the storm and finally see the golden sky, just as the lyrics described.

## 36 想去还未去的国家 (Done)

如果将来有机会，我非常希望能够去英国旅行。英国是欧洲的一个发达国家，非常漂亮的岛国；无论是城市还是自然风光都非常值得赞赏；城市建设很好，自然风光也很漂亮；既可以享受海景，也可以享受苏格兰高地的自然风光，而且历史也非常悠久。我可以去伦敦参观美丽而又富有历史气息的城市，去看看大本钟，看看泰晤士河；也可以去参观苏格兰的城堡。当然，我之所以想去英国，主要是因为我是利物浦的球迷，我非常想去利物浦市的安菲尔德球场看一场伟大的足球比赛；同时，去感受一些利物浦市的夜景也是非常不错的主意。要知道，利物浦市曾经是英格兰的第二大港口城市，还是2008年欧洲文化之都，也很多可以欣赏的地方。对了，利物浦市还是披头士的故乡呢，尽管我对音乐并不是那么感兴趣。

If there is a chance in the future, I would like to travel to the UK very much. It is a developed country in Europe, a very beautiful island. It is said that both urban and natural scenery of the UK are very worthy to enjoy. The urban construction is very modern while its natural scenery is very beautiful. And I can enjoy the sea view,  a lot of old castles and the natural scenery of Scotland Highlands. Oh, I would like to visit London as it is such a beautiful and historic city, with famous Big Ben and Thames River. However, the most important reason that I would like to go to the UK is because I am a loyal fun of Liverpool Football Club. So I would be very happy if I could go to Liverpool's Anfield stadium to watch a great football game. Besides that, Liverpool is also a very important city in England. As I remember, it has been the second largest port city of England. BTW, it is also culture Capital of Enrupe in2008. And my wife would like the night scene of Liverpool very much. Oh, it is also  hometown of the Beatles, so I guess we can heard beautiful music there although I was not so interested in music.

## 43 有关健康的文章 (Done)

You should say:
What is tha article about healthy life
where  How felt  why love

我一年前在知乎网上看到一篇讲健康的文章，它的主题是如何改善睡眠我觉得这篇文章讲得非常好，它首先介绍了睡眠质量对于身体健康的重要性；然后描述了通常睡眠质量不好的现象；接着分析了睡眠质量不好的原因，最后给出了一些有效的建议来改善睡眠。我喜欢这篇文章是因为我的睡眠质量真的非常糟糕；我现在尝试着按照这篇文章的建议改善我的睡眠，现在已经有了一些效果；虽然我的睡眠还不是足够好，但至少即使我加班到很晚，我也还可以拥有一个过得去的睡眠，不至于在每天早晨醒来的时候觉得头痛。当然，我还需要按照上面的建议继续放松自己，减轻自己的心理压力来获得更好的睡眠从而拥有更健康的身体。

A year ago, I saw an article about health from the a website named Zhihu.com. Its topic is how to improve sleep. I think this article is very good. It first introduces the importance of sleep quality for physical health, and then describes the phenomenon of poor sleep quality, after that it analyzes the causes of poor sleep quality, and finally gives some effective suggestions to improve sleep. I like this article because my sleep quality is really bad. I am trying to improve my sleep with the suggestion of this article. It's been a little more effective. Even though I don’t sleep good enough, it has been much better than before as I don’t have a headache when I wake up every morning. Of course, I also need to continue to follow the above recommendations to relax myself. If I could ease psychological pressure as the article said, I guess I could get better sleep and thus have a more healthy body.
