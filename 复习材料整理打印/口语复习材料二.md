## 1 喜欢乘飞机的人

我有个高中时候的女同学叫做Shelly, 据我所知她现在非常喜欢坐飞机旅行。有趣的是，她从清华大学毕业后在交通部工作，所以，我猜想，她喜欢坐飞机旅行是因为她非常清楚在各种交通方式中哪种更适合她，她也谈到过坐飞机其实非常安全，仅有的不方便就是需要在机场等待，但是她已经很有经验来控制提前到达机场的时间。她经常去国内各个城市出差，偶尔也会去马来西亚、新加坡旅游；有的时候，航空公司还会给她赠送机票，因为她累计的里程非常多。我想，我认识的人中她是最喜欢乘坐飞机的人了。

I have a high school female students named Shelly, as far as I know she is very fond of traveling by air. Interestingly, after she graduated from Qinghua University in the Department of Transportation to work, so, I guess, she likes to travel by plane because she was very clear in various transportation modes which is more suitable for her, she also talked about the fact the plane very safe, only inconvenience is the need to wait at the airport, but she has a lot of experience to control the advance arrival time at the airport. She often went to various cities in the country on a business trip, and occasionally go to Malaysia, Singapore Tourism; sometimes, airline tickets will give her gift as she accumulated mileage very much. I think, people I know, she is a favorite of people flying.

## 4 等待 (Done)

生小孩

分娩也可以用delivery

As a father, I would like to talk about my waiting for my baby's birth in 25th, April 2012. My wife needs to do a c-section (剖腹产或者 caesarean，建议用c-section) as there was something wrong with her womb (wu:m). So I was still very nervous although the operation was arranged in the best hospital in Hangzhou. And of course, I was very excited and I could't wait to see my baby alouthgh I didn't know the baby's gender. The c-section started from about 2:30 pm and it was really a long wait for me. My mother in law and I waited outside the 
operation room and I couldn't sit down at all. I was walking up and down. I was excited because I was going to be a father. I'm very nervous and worried becasue my wife was some kind of high risk delivery women. Thanks God. My wife and daughter were pull outside the operation room at 4:09, lying on the bed and both healthy. It was really interesting and important experience for me and I was really very happy to wait at that time alghough I am not patient at all. And now I am waiting for my baby girl's grown up and in my opinion, it is another long and happy waiting. I really enjoy it.

## 9 成功 (Done)

升为SA的答辩

关于成功，我想起了在2012年下半年成功得到系统架构师职位的事情。在2012年的时候，我已经作为高级工程师在Nero杭州分公司工作了好几年了，然后由于公司的结构调整，原有的德国架构师离职了，我有机会得到这个职位。但是由于这个职位比较重要，所以我需要通过一个由公司的技术专家们组织的一个答辩。我的主管给了我这个机会，我也在答辩过程中充分展示了自己的技术能力以及自己过往的工作贡献，尽管PPT做得不是特别漂亮，而且部分关于技术架构的问题回答得不是特别好，但我还是顺利得到了这个职位，从而承担起项目的架构职责。我当然对于这次成功感到非常开心。但是非常不幸的是，接下来几年由于公司另外一个重要产品的失败，公司整体的情况不景气，发展越来越糟糕，为了我自己的发展，我也在2014年离开了公司；所以，很遗憾，没有在这个重要的职位上发挥更多的作用。但这次成功还是给自己的简历加分不少

Regarding of success, I think of things in the second half of 2012 to get the job of the system architect which mainly focuses on provide solutions and architectures for software. In 2012, I had worked as a senior engineer at Nero Hangzhou branch for several years, and then I had the opportunity to get the job because of the company's structural adjustment. However, as this position is very important, I need to pass a defense organized by the company. My supervisor has given me this opportunity. I also fully demonstrated my technical ability and contribution  in the process of defense , although the PPT was not particularly beautiful. I remember that I didn’t answer some difficult questions but the Committee of Defense was still satisfied with my performance and then I got position. Of course I am very happy with this success. Unfortunately, in the next few years as a result of the failure of the company’s business, the company's overall situation is not booming then I left the company in 2014 and turned to develop mobile applications. So I was pity that I did not play more roles in this position. But this success still makes my resume more valuable, I guess.

## 38 忘记的重要事情：(Done)

我曾经非常为我的记忆力和细心而自豪。不过，随着年龄的增长，长期的加班与使用电脑，我必须承认，我的记忆力下降得很快。比如，在今年6月初的时候，我就忘记还我的信用卡了。我本应该在每个月的5号来还信用卡，以前我大概会在3号就会还掉。但是那个月我正好要加班工作，同时我也在寻找新的工作机会，所以尽管我安装了一些移动应用来提醒我还款，我还是非常不幸的忘记了这件事情。在6号的时候，我的太太提醒了我，我才想起来。我当时非常担心，因为我曾经听说，如果忘记还了信用卡，需要支付全额的高昂的罚息，同时对自己的信用记录有影响。不过幸运的是，我打电话给银行的工作人员，他们告诉我说，会有两天的缓冲期的。于是，我赶紧还清了信用卡，总算是没有造成额外的不良影响。

I have been very proud of my memory and carefulness. However, with the growth of the age, I have to admit that my memory is falling fast because of over using of computer in the midnights. For example, in the beginning of June in this year, I forgot to pay my credit card’s bill. I was supposed to pay my bill in the 5th day of every month and normally I payed my bill in 3rd day. But during that period,  I just had to work overtime every day, and I was looking for new jobs so I was exhausted every day.  So even though I installed some mobile applications to remind me of the repayment, I still forgot it.  In June 6th, I thought of it as my wife reminded me. I was very worried because I have ever heard, if I forget the bill, I need to pay a high penalty, and I would got a bad credit record. Fortunately, After I called the bank's staff, they told me that there will be a buffer period of two days. So I quickly paid off the credit card and thanks god, there was no additional adverse effects.


## 46 噪音

在古荡时的狗叫
2013年我住在古荡小区的时候，早上经常可以听到狗叫的声音。你知道吗，那可是在早上7电哦，那个时候大多数人都还在睡觉呢。而且应该是很大的狗叫得很响的声音。我一般在那个时候都还没起床，而且，我的小宝宝也需要睡觉啊。刚开始几天，有噪音的时候，我只是忽略了，因为我猜想这只是偶尔才会发生的事情吧。可是这个噪音持续了好几天，于是我下去寻找了一下，这才发现原来是一条非常大的狗，它的主人并不在家。我和狗主人谈了噪音的事情，可是她非常不礼貌，不讲道理；我非常生气，准备像政府部门投诉。不过还没等到我打电话呢，当天晚上我就听说相关部门过来解决这个问题了，我猜想是有别的邻居投诉了吧！谢天谢地，我现在的小区里倒没有发生类似的事情。

2013 I live in Gudang cell when the morning can often hear the sound of dogs barking. You know, that's at 7:00 electric Oh, at that time most people are still sleeping. And it should be a lot of barking very loud voice. I usually get up at that time have not, moreover, my little baby need to sleep ah. Just started a few days, when there is noise, I just ignored it because I guess things happen only occasionally now. But this noise lasted for several days, so I go looking for a bit and discovered that the original is a very large dog, its owner was not at home. My dog owners talked about the noise thing, but she was very rude, unreasonable; I am very angry, like government departments to prepare a complaint. But even before I called it that evening I heard over the relevant departments to solve this problem, and I guess there are other neighbors complained it! Thankfully, I am now in the area pour something similar does not happen.


## 47 长时间相处的家人

一定要是the most time with吗？我觉得还是直接说小孩吧

坦白说，自从我上高中开始，我就很少和家人在一起，因为我需要去外地上学，每个月才回家一次。至于现在，我花最多时间陪伴的当然是我三岁的宝贝女儿了。我愿意和她一起做任何事情，包括给她讲故事啦，陪她玩一些幼稚的游戏啦，陪她说话，陪她看动画片，甚至让她陪我看足球比赛。工作日的时候我工作比较忙，所以只能晚上陪她。我周末的所有时间几乎都是在陪她，我觉得这样也很有意思，我很享受和她一起的时光，尽管某些游戏实在是太幼稚了。我觉得，作为一个父亲而言，尽管工作很忙，我还是应该多陪伴她，让她感觉到家庭的温暖。否则，她作为一个独生子女，会太寂寞了，陪伴她会对她的成长有好处，让她有个美好的童年。

Frankly, since I started high school, I rarely with my family, because I need to go to the field school, only to go home once a month. For now, I spend the most time with, of course, my three year old baby girl. I would like her to do anything together, including her storytelling friends, to accompany her friends to play some childish game, to accompany her, to accompany her to watch cartoons, and even let her accompany me to watch football matches. Days when I work busy, so only with her at night. Almost all of my time on weekends are with her, I think this is very interesting, I enjoyed time with her, even though some of the game is too naive. I think, as a father, despite busy work, I should spend more time with her, let her feel the warmth of the family. Otherwise, she was as a child, will be lonely, she would accompany her growth is good, so she had a wonderful childhood.

## 48 长时间步行

瑞士那次

2012年我和几位同事去德国出差，然后在一个阳光明媚的周末，我们自驾来到了瑞士，在阿尔卑斯山脚下一个叫做因特拉肯的小镇游玩。而其中一个重要的项目就是在阿尔卑斯山上徒步。我们先是在山顶游玩并且吃了午饭，然后乘坐缆车到半山腰；然后从半山腰一起往下徒步。这是最美好最伟大的徒步路线之一，虽然是山路，但是非常平坦；最重要的是，周围就是阿尔卑斯山的美景，我们边走边看着周围的雪山，看到白雪和植被的分割线，还看到了插着瑞士国旗的一些民间建筑。那天的天气也非常非常好，不热也不冷，微风吹得非常舒服，阳光照在身上暖暖的。虽然我们最终步行了将近三个小时才到达我们停车的地方，但是我们一点都不觉得累，而是非常享受。这是我人生中最美好的旅行之一，要知道，出国旅行并且在美丽的阿尔卑斯山徒步可是非常难得的。

2012 I and several colleagues went to Germany on a business trip, and then on a sunny weekend, we arrived by car in Switzerland, at the foot of the Alps in Interlaken town called play. And one of the important projects is in the Alps on foot. We first play at the top and ate lunch, and then take the cable car to the hillside; then walk together down from the hillside. This is one of the most beautiful hiking trails of the greatest, although the mountain, but very flat; most importantly, is surrounded by the Alps, we walked around looking at the snow-capped mountains to see snow and vegetation of the dividing line, Also see the Swiss flag stuck some folk architecture. The weather is also very, very good, it is not hot nor cold, very comfortable breeze blowing, the sun shines on the body warm. Although we eventually walk nearly three hours to get to our parking place, but we do not feel tired, but very enjoyable. This is one of the best trips of my life, you know, to travel abroad and in the beautiful Alps on foot are very rare.

## 49 长途自驾游

瑞士那次

2012年四月我和几位同事去德国出差，然后在一个阳光明媚的周末，我们自驾来到了瑞士，在阿尔卑斯山脚下一个叫做因特拉肯的小镇游玩。在那之前，我还没去过国外旅行。之前，我们考虑过乘坐火车去瑞士旅行，不过其中一个同事说，四个人一起开车去会更方便快捷。而且，从公司租借车非常方便，不需要额外的费用，算下来也更便宜一些，所以我们就租了一辆奔驰车。当然，其中有同事有驾照并且有自驾到奥地利的经历，也是我们坐车过去的原因之一。我们一路从德国的卡尔斯鲁尔开车到了因特拉肯，中间经过了苏黎世和卢塞恩吧，我们一直沿着阿尔卑斯山开，沿路可以充分领略山景。而到达因特拉肯的第二天，我们还开车到山脚下，因为我们要通过缆车上山。我很享受这个旅行，当然，那个开车的哥们会觉得稍微有点累吧！

April 2012 I and several colleagues went to Germany on a business trip, and then on a sunny weekend, we arrived by car in Switzerland, at the foot of the Alps in Interlaken town called play. Before that, I have not been traveling abroad. Before, we considered travel by train to Switzerland, but one of my colleagues said, four men drove together to be more convenient. Moreover, from the company leased car is very easy to use, no additional cost, doing also cheaper, so we rented a Mercedes car. Of course, some colleagues have a driver's license and have a car to go through Austria, it is one of the reasons we ride past. We drove all the way from Germany's Karlsruhe to Interlaken, in the middle of it after the Zurich and Lucerne, we have been open along the Alps, along the road can fully enjoy the mountain views. Interlaken to reach the next day, we drove to the foot of the hill, because we want to pass the cable car up the mountain. I really enjoyed this trip, of course, that drove the man will feel a little bit tired of it!

## 50 重要谈话

读高中的谈话吧！

我想谈论的是在我从初中升到高中时，我的初中班主任找我和我父亲谈的话，那应该是发生在十几年前了吧。那个时候我成绩很不错，可以去县城最好的高中读书，但是家里很穷，上高中需要一大笔学费，当时不一定能够负担得起，何况我还有一个妹妹要读书。有一个私立的学校邀请我去他们学校读书，承诺免除学费，我父亲动心了。我之前的班主任得到这个消息后，过来劝我爸爸不要为了一点学费就让我去差一些的学校。最好，在他的劝说下，我还是去了最好的高中。我想，如果我去了那所私立的学校，可能会因为没有足够的竞争而考不上好大学，也没办法认识那么多优秀可爱的同学，也许，人生轨迹就会完全不一样了。

I want to talk about that when I rose from junior high school, my junior high school teacher and my father talk to me, then it should happen in ten years ago now. At that time my grades were very good, you can go to the county of the best high school, but the family was poor, need a lot of high school tuition, was not always able to afford, not to mention I have a younger sister to school. There is a private school invited me to go to their school, commitment free tuition, my father relented. I get this message before homeroom, came to persuade my father not to let me go a little worse tuition schools. Preferably, at his persuasion, I went to the best school. I think that if I went to private school, may be because there is not enough competition and not get into a good university, there is no way to know so many good students cute, perhaps, life will be completely different trajectory.

I want to talk about it in my junior high school when I was in junior high school, my father and my father to talk to me and my father, it should be a decade ago. That time I was very good, you can go to the best high school in the county, but the family is very poor, high school needs a lot of tuition fees, was not necessarily able to afford, and I have a sister to read. There is a private school invited me to their school, promised to waive tuition, my father relented. Before I got the news, I came to persuade my father not to make me go to school for a little tuition. Best, in his persuasion, I still went to the best high school. I think, if I go to that private school, it may be because there is not enough competition and the exam is not good university, also can not know so many good and lovely students, perhaps, life will be completely different.
