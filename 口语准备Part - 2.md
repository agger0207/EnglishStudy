### Question
Describe a place you went to that was full of
colour.

You should say:
where it was;
why you went there;
what you did there;
and explain why you think this place was made so
colourful.


难点分析：首先一些烤鸭会觉得这道题的答题素材选取就很难：“到底怎样才算colourful？“，其次在回答时要让考官觉得你讲的这个地方full
of colour也有一定的难度。


备考建议：如果看过了许多美景，会有很多可选的素材：九寨沟、哈尼梯田、莫高窟、香格里拉……但在居住的城市里，同样有不少多彩的地方：鲜花盛开的公园、过节时的灯会、花市，郊外的一片花海，各色灯光的城市夜景、天马行空的涂鸦墙壁等都是不错的素材选择。


是否可以说长乐林场 (多种颜色，树木，枫叶, 蓝天，白云)

红得异常耀眼,银杏树叶则黄得发亮,红、黄、绿等各种颜色应有尽有

Nature; 

站在堤坝上，向西望去，碧波荡漾，波光粼粼，在水库的尽头是一大片火红的枫叶加上挺拔的红杉，枯红的树叶映衬在翠绿的树林中，倒影在清澈的水库湖面，真是多姿多彩，色彩斑斓，可谓色彩的海洋。眺望南面，则是象极了富士山的娘娘山。

娘山属于天目山之东脉，位于杭州余杭区余杭镇西北13公里的祝园村内，海拔397.7米，是余杭最高的山。娘娘山的山脚下有甘岭水库，山背面是长乐林场。最早知道娘娘山和长乐林场，是沙子11月28日发给我的一个论坛贴子，我第一眼看到照片就被“秒杀”了：成排的杉树林一眼看不到头，地上积着厚厚的落叶，仿佛多年来都未曾被清理，脚一踩上去就能发出“嘎吱、嘎吱”的声音，林场深处是一个水库，静寂的落叶覆住湖面，看上去透着一股寂寥的美，俨如一幅美丽的山水画卷。看过后立即与沙子定下，30日去长乐看最美秋色，行车线路都规划拉好，结果29日沙子说因腰骨不慎扭伤他去勿成，实在是太可惜了。
        11月30日早上7点30分，我们11人按沙子规划的线路，准时从冶水广场出发，前往长乐林场，导航也直接导到长乐林场。到余杭下高速后，由于遇到一处断头路（在修路）必须绕行，结果到长乐林场后，找不到上娘娘山的入口，一路上也没有什么指示牌，开了不少冤枉路。我们费了很大的劲才找到甘岭水库，原本三个小时到目地的行程，多开了一小时，上午11点30分才到达水库脚下，心中不免为后面的行程担心，毕竟谁也没来这里玩过。
停好车辆，整好装备，我们向水库出发。远远望去，水库堤坝上有不少游客，到坝上后，更是发现一队队的户外运动者云集在这一块赏秋之地。站在堤坝上，向西望去，碧波荡漾，波光粼粼，在水库的尽头是一大片火红的枫叶加上挺拔的红杉，枯红的树叶映衬在翠绿的树林中，倒影在清澈的水库湖面，真是多姿多彩，色彩斑斓，可谓色彩的海洋。眺望南面，则是象极了富士山的娘娘山。
        往上水库右边的石阶上去后，小猪说线路不对，按照六只脚上标注的线路，我们应该往水库左边的小路进去。大家停下脚步，再次认识查看了六只脚上的地图，确认如此，返回到堤坝上后向南边的山路出发。说是山路其实是一条防火道，由于比较平坦，所以并不难走。队伍往前走了250米左右，左侧就可看到一个小水库，地图上标明是里湖塘水库。水库岸边芦苇丛丛，芦花摇曳，更有几枝枫叶正红，可谓秋色甚浓。

After I graduated from high school, I went to the seashore in Xiamen with my best friends. I really miss the days when we stayed together and shared our secrets to each other. At that time, we were so young, so innocent and isolated from sophistication（世故）. We took many pictures together on the beach, wearing colorful skirts or jams, free from the pressure we had before. But those bright skirts and jams were not the only things that decorated the seashore. Various new things lightened up the time when we stayed there. We swam in the blue sea, we surfed on the aqua surfboard and we even took several diving lessons. Those bright colors indicated the energy of young people. I would like to return to this place not only because of the scenic （风景优美的）landscape in bright colors but also because of the time I spent with my friends. I still remember that when we sat on the beach, we claimed our blueprint for our prospect and expressed our grievance for leaving each other. We were so young and so cheerful but time also passed by and the only thing can bring us back to that time is the colorful photo.## 29 儿歌
### QuestionDescribe a childhood songyou remember well.
 You should say: Where you first heardthis song; How old you were whenyou first heard it; What it was about it; And explain how you feel now when you hear this song.  
### Answer 
 The child hood song that I want to talk about is “Mom is the best in the world”. I really think that it is really human touch.（有人情味的）The first time I heard this music was about 7 years old as a primary school student. And it is said that the song is an interlude (插曲) in one movie named“Mom please love me again”, which was a  tearjerker (催人泪下) movie between 1980s and 1990s.  What’smore, the typical example I can present you is that, at that time, almost every audience bursts into tears while they are listening to the music and watching the movie, which is mainly about the great and selfness maternal love.  I remember that it was a cold winter evening. And I was having the music lesson at school. At music class, our  teacher played the music “mom is the best in theworld” to us. After playing the music, our teacher taught us to  sing the song.At that time, the impressive lyrics grabbled my attention so quickly. And the lyrics said “The mother is the best world, and we need to cherish what we have in our life.” And I was moved by the lyrics and felt guilty that I was always so rebellious at home and did not follow any reasonable advices my mother told me. Therefore, I decided to behave well after learning the music.  Thanksto the childhood music which is full maternal love, I began to value the peoplearound me who loved me so much. Even so far, I still regard the childhood musicas the best music to extol(歌颂) the maternal love.自己可以描述上学歌

### Question
Describe a happy event from your childhood that you remember well.
You should say:
What the event was
When and where it happened
What you saw or did
And explain why you remember this event so well
 
### Answer 
Ok right then, well after a bit of thought, the family event that I’d like to talk to you about was the wedding of one of my aunts. And I guess the reason I remember it so well is because it was the first wedding I’d ever been to, so it left quite a lasting impression on me. And I was really young at the time, you know, I was only about 5 or 6, so I guess I must have been one of the youngest people there.
 
And uh, the wedding took place in some restaurant in our hometown. I can’t tell you the exact name of the place cos I honestly can’t remember, but what I can tell you is that it was a pretty big place, because I mean, there must have been at least a couple of hundred people there.
 
And as for what happened, well it was basically just a typical wedding party, you know, with loads of food and drink, although unfortunately I was too young to be able to enjoy all the wine and champagne on offer!  But at least I got to enjoy all the food, which there was absolutely masses of! And another thing I remember quite clearly was playing around with the microphone, and saying a few words into it. You know, I’d never seen a microphone before, so it felt pretty cool speaking into it and hearing my voice come out through the speakers.
 
And uh… yeah, there’s not really that much more to say about it! So… thanks for listening! 
 
Notes:
it left quite a lasting impression on me -留下了难忘的印象
I must have been one of the youngest people there – 我应该是最小的人之一
in some restaurant – 在某个饭店
there must have been at least a couple of hundred people there – 应该有至少两百人再那里了
typical – 典型的
loads of – lots of
I got to enjoy… – I could enjoy, 我可以享受…
there was absolutely masses of food – 有好多好多吃的！
the speakers  - 音响
There’s not really that much more to say about it! – 基本上没有别的话可说了
 
Other phrases:
It was a really fun day, and because I was one of the youngest people there, I got a lot of attention, and everyone was really nice to me.
 
So yeah, all in all it was a pretty cool day!
 
I remember that day I was, like, dressed up in a suit, which was the first time in my life I think I had been dressed so smartly! So that also made the occasion feel a little bit extra special, if you know what I mean!

### Question	A restaurant you like/impresses you	1. Where this restaurant is2. What type of food the restaurant has3. Why you go to this restaurantExplain why you like this restaurant/why this restaurant impresses you"### Answer 1Talking about the restaurant I like, it reminds me of a small one named “Chufeng”, which locates in Zijingang Campus of Zhejiang University. The name means Hubei flavor restaurant for the owner of the restaurant comes from Hubei. And Chu is the ancient state in Hubei Province. (The owner of the restaurant comes from my hometown. )So besides everyday food, it serves lots of my hometown specialties ,such as Reganmian, Sanxiandoupi and Nuomiji， which I could hardly find from other restaurants here. （You know, Reganmian is the most famous breakfast in my hometown. And it was on the show of “A bite of China”.）Why I go there? Actually it was my sister who recommended the restaurant to me. She knew how I had been missing hometown food all this time for I’ve been away from home so long. I’ll never forget the excitement in her voice when she told me all about the special restaurant she accidentally run into. So I went there and ordered Reganmian the next day. Ever since, I have become a regular there. Maybe for many people, this sloppy restaurant is not even worthy mentioning but for me, an outlander of the city l live, it means a world for the food here is the very same food that I’ve been literarily eating through all my childhood and it tastes like home.

a taste and knows how to use the space. the house is made into a bar and the
dinning zone ,the red table sheet with a vase of tulip ,accompanied by the dark
warm light above each table ,creates the atmosphere of romance, which is perfect
for love birds and those high-end business minds .
2. As the good reputation of the service and the taste, it's usually out of tables
without the reservation; you are going to wait forever. But the chef will make the
wait worthwhile .Besides the dishes always cooked perfectly; they are always
served in time. the staff are always hospitable to diners , though it could be you
first stop by , you will be served with all the decencies .

food, the bill is still moderate, affordable for most middle class. It’s the place for
friends to enjoy a wonderful time

## 33 公园
### QuestionA park/garden you visited and liked/that impressed you.Where it was2. What it looked like3. What people did there4. Explain how you felt about this garden.### Answer The park I like is Bailu Park, which locates in the northwest of my home. It takes about 10 minutes walk there from my home.  Bailu Park, which locates at the northwest of my home, is a fairly big one in liangzhu town. (And it just takes 10 minutes to drive there.) It’s a very beautiful and peaceful park with a wide meadow, various trees and winding sideways, as well as a trickling creek goes through the park. Apart from the charming nature view, it’s also equipped with many facilities for entertainment and exercise, such as basketball courts, kids’ corner, swings and so on. Therefore, it’s very likely to see lot of people hang out there at weekends. Some are jogging, some are playing basketball while children are playing games there.Having a picnic with my family in the park is one of my favorite activities. It’s a great enjoyment to lay on the meadow with a tree shade over you while I can also have a chat or play games with your family. (For me, it’s a wonderful way to reveal working pressure. ) Moreover, in the park, we can embrace the nature beauty meanwhile we can truly enjoy the family gathering and collecting the family bond instead of gluing our eyes onto the screens of computer and television. ( which keep our loving ones outside. ) So that’s why Bailu park (is a great resort for a working break and family recreations) my favorite park.

### QuestionA piece of good news you heard from TV or the Internet1. What the news was about2. When you got this news?3. Where you got this news?Explain why you think it was a good piece of news?
### Answer The piece of good news I learned from the Internet is that there is going to be a public kindergarten near my neighborhood in this September. My baby girl is going to the pre-school this year, so I always pay attention to these kinds of news. I got this news from Internet last month and after that I confirmed it with the administrator of the kindergarten. 
Currently most of the children in my neighborhood go to a kindergarten, which is about 5 km away from home. As you know, most of the children are taken care of by their grandparents, who don’t know how to drive. It is very inconvenient for them to come back and forth from school and home with their babies especially on the rainy or snowy days.
I used to concern about the pick-ups for my baby girl when she goes to school. Now it all works out. With the opening of this new kindergarten, our children could go to school within a walking distance. So it is such a great piece of news for me and many other parents.

### Question
Describe a place near water that you enjoyed visiting.

You should say
Where this place was
What you did at this place
Who you went there with
And explain why you liked this place.

### Answer
Well, speaking of the locations near water, I’ve got several locations to share with you. But during these places, the most attracting one is a café near the Westlake in Hangzhou. I was born and grew up in Shanghai. Although it’s quite near to the Westlake in Hangzhou, frankly speaking, I hadn’t got the chance to go there until last month. One of my friend is now living in Hangzhou, so she invited me and another friend to go there during the weekend. After having lunch in a famous restaurant, she took us to a café which’s located beside the Westlake. The café was well-decorated with European style, when I stepped into the café, I was soon attracted by the colourful paintings on the wall. Even the coffee cups were delicate. However, the thing I like most is that I could drink delicious coffee while enjoying the glamourous scenery of the Westlake since we were sitting on the table by the window. Through the window, I could also see the magnificent Leifeng pagoda. The natural scenery and the delicious cappuccino really helped me a lot in releasing my pressure of preparing IELTS. If I go to Hangzhou the next time, I will definitely come back to this café again.

　　Describe a pleasant surprise you had.
　　You should say:
　　1.when and where it happened
　　2.who gave you the surprise
　　3.why they gave you the surprise
　　4.and explain how you felt about it.### Answer 1

http://ielts.zhan.com/tifen/21988.html编故事：女儿送礼物
A pleasant surprise is always a joyful thing. I have received many surprises in my life, but there is one surprise that I really want to mention cuz it left a deep impression on me until now, well, definitely a good and pleasant impression. It was on December 31st 2014, just a couple of hours before the arrival of new year. I was preparing for the New Year’s party with my friends here in Shanghai. I heard someone ring the bell on the door and my friend come to open the door. Then he say to me “They come for you, they said they are your friends” I was still busy with my stuff so I replied without even taking a glance at the strangers at the door “ So who are they?” Then when I turn around I found 2 familiar figures standing in front of me, then I yelled “ Oh my god, you guys? Seriously?” They are my childhood mates coming back from Japan to pay me a visit in this particular time of the year. There is famous saying in China “There’s nothing more joyful than a friend from far come to visit you”
To be frank, I have been expecting them come back to join my party at this special occasion, cuz it think it’s a time that faithful friends join together. So their unexpected visit was truly a dream come true. Later I know that they had arranged this visit for more than a month and decide to arrive at the last day of 2013 to celebrate the New Year with me, we haven’t met for almost 3 years and last time we met was still in Tokyo, so it’s really pleasant that I can catch up with them, plus, I was in such an exciting moment, I really can’t figure out anything more cheerful than this. I felt like I was surrounded by the warm atmosphere of ushering the new year and enjoying the valuable friendship, that was definitely the best new year’s eve I’ve ever had.

### Answer 2
For a long time I had been longing for a piano of my own to practise on.
　　There was a piano shop on the street through which I went to school every day. Whenever I passed the shop,  looking at the piano which stood in the corner of the shop window. How I had been dreaming day and night to possess a piano like that!
　　Unfortunately, my father was just a clerk, he could not afford to buy me an expensive piano, though he knew that I was very anxious for one.
　　On my birthday, I went as usual to the shop window to look at the piano, but to my surprise the piano had gone. In fact, I should not have been surprised, others had the right to buy it, if they could affird to. Tears filled my eyes when I thought of not being able to see that piano any more.
　　I had just come back school, I heard my mother calling me. I brushed away my tears and went into the dining room where she was. I could not believe my eyes. There was the piano, my piano. "Am I dreaming?" I said to myself. "Come to the piano." my mother told me. I approached it and lifted the glossy lid of the piano, then touched the keys with my fingers. What beautiful tone! I held Mother's hand, not knowing what to say. I knew at once that it was a gift from Father. How I wished that I could kiss him right there! He was still in office working. I waited eagerly for his return.
　　As soon as he appeared, I held him tight and kissed him. Hot tears were running down my cheeks when I said, "Thank you very much, Dad!" I could find no words that could express my feelings at that time.
　　Father had cut down his expenses on cigarettes in order to save up enough money for the gift. How generous and kind of him!
　　That birthday was the happiest one I had ever had. Later, much later, I came to realize that although the gift was costly, no gift could measure the love of my parents for me.

What a coincidence that I was just be a part of fantastic project. Last summer I went to Hong Kong for a summer program, which is about ‘creative industry’. At the end of the ten-day journey, we five as a team need to hand in a report.

On the first day, Monica, Rachel, Scott and Mark and I formed the team and get down to the work together. Mark was a cheerful guy from the Netherlands, while we four came from mainland.
We didn’t know each other before and we chose Monica to be our team leader because she seemed to have some experience in mock marketing.

Our job was about designing an original product never seen in the market, describing it and persuading others that it was worth buying. We didn’t need to make an real product, just ideas.
The first five days, we do lots of brainwashing and arguments, Most of the time, some of us bring about a good idea, but after some discussing soon it shortcoming was pointed out The good thing was, the more we discussed, the closer we got to the final stuff we want to sell. Finally we made an awesome product which all of us had a strong desire to buy. On the last three days, we started our paper work. Monica wrote the thought map of the ieda, Rachel and I were in charge of designing product’s exterior and usage, as well as Scott and Mark making an effort on the sales scheme. It sold well during the judges and we snatch a high scores. All of us went out to a bar for a celebration.

A team is always a good place to bring out the best of every member and listening is the great beginning of every successful communication.

### Answer
可以说自己帮助腿受伤的同学上楼梯


Well. There are times when people need other’s help and lend a helping hand to others as well. I am no exception. Last year, I helped my roommate to see a doctor as she could barely walk because of the great pain caused by kidney stone.

Actually, it was in a snowy morning, I waked up and saw that she was trembling all over and as white as a sheet in her bed. She thought it would be alright after a while. Without a second thought, I took all the cash I had and helped her to get dressed, and then we hurried to the nearest hospital in a taxi. However, after all the difficulties we had in catching a taxi and all the coldness and pain my roommate suffered, the hospital did not put an immediate end to it. We had to stand in a long line to pay the registration fee first. What pissed me off was that there were still more patients before us waiting to see the doctor. Later, with prescription in hand, I had to do the whole waiting thing again to pay for and pick up medicine separately. Thankfully, the acute pain of my roommate was greatly relieved by a shot of painkiller. As we returned to school, I put her to bed and saw her grateful look.

For my part, I think it is quite natural to help people we care about and expect nothing in return. And I believe a friend in need is a friend indeed. Besides, I do enjoy the feeling of being needed.

Notes:

学习一些使用的表达：

there are times when – 有时候

lend a helping hand – 伸援手

as white as a sheet – 形容脸色苍白

put an immediate end to – 使……快点结束

registration fee – 挂号费

piss somebody off – 使人恼火

thankfully – 可以表示“庆幸的是”。thankful一般用来表示对拥有的美好的一切感恩，或者庆幸躲过了某些灾祸、不幸。例如He wasn't badly hurt—that's something to be thankful for. I was thankful to see they'd all arrived safely.

而grateful – 表示对某人“感激的”，例如I am extremely grateful to all the teachers for their help. 注意I am thankful to all the teachers for their help. 这个表达是不恰当的。 

expect nothing in return – 不期回报

a friend in need is a friend indeed – 患难见真情


### Sample 
A situation I helped someone, it happed at the beginning of the 2nd semester when I was a freshmen in the university. My roommate Cherry was so kind-hearted that she lent all her money to a girl who had claimed herself as a student and ran out of money. At last, it turned out that person was a fraud and could not be reached when Cherry realized that there was something wrong.She was too afraid to tell her parents that she gave all her money to a stranger. Meanwhile she didn’t know what to do without her living expense.So I helped Cherry to call the police, went to the police station with her and took deposition there. Then I lent her some money and introduced a part-time job to her. Besides I told my classmates about her story, and all of us agreed to vote her as the winner of 1st class scholarship that year. So she made it without asking her parents for more money and earned all the money by herself. I was glad that I helped her out and we had become close friends since then.

### Answer
可以考虑去德国的那两次；一次是坐错车，一次是因为罢工

The last time I got lost in another city was in 2014. I went to Beijing together with two of my friends for our summer vacation. We all felt exalted to be in the capital of our country, but soon we became anxious when we got lost. As a metropolitan, Beijing has very complex road network. Someone with no sense of direction like us will easily get lost even using a map or following the instruction of GPS. Besides, Beijing is a historic city with a large number of tourist attractions. Some tourist attractions are quite near to each other, so we didn’t have to take the bus just walked to the next attraction. We soon regretted our decision not to take the bus since we couldn’t find the right way. On our way to the next destination, we chatted with each other and were engrossed in our conversation. All of a sudden we lost track of where we were. And the worst thing was, the signals of our cell phones were not very good and we could not connect to the digital map. We were so worried and didn’t know what to do. There were hardly any people on that quiet street. We had to keep on walking and we all hoped that we could meet someone who knew the right way. Fortunately, we met a local at an intersection and asked him for help. He drew us a simple map which finally led us to our destination.

### Question
Describe an unusual building you’ve visited
You should say
Where it is
What it is used for
What it looks like
And explain why you think it is unusual
 
### Answer 
 
Ok right then, well the building I’ve decided to talk about is The Oriental Pearl Tower, at least I think that’s the name of it in English, cos um, I normally always call it by its Chinese name, which is 东方明珠.
 
Anyway, as for where it is, well it’s basically right in the middle of Shanghai, on the Pudong side, but you can see it across from the river, and I think it’s probably fair to say that it’s the main focal point of the city. You know, you can’t really miss it!
 
And um, regarding what it’s actually used for, well I guess it was built primarily to act as a TV transmission tower, although it’s more of a tourist attraction now. I mean, that’s what people know it as really! And um, if you haven’t seen it before, it’s basically like, um, how can I put it? Um… it’s kind of just like a tall pointed tower with a load of balls stacked on top of each other, some bigger than others. So it’s actually pretty simple in design, but there’s something about it that makes it look really cool and unique. Oh and I also shouldn’t forget to mention that, at night, it’s lit up really well, and I think most people would agree that it actually looks quite a lot better at night than it does during the day. But anyway, um… what else is there to say about it? Uh… I suppose it also looks kind of futuristic in a way, you know, like something out of a sci-fi film! So yeah, it’s a really cool building.
 
And in terms of why I think it’s unusual, well I guess there’s not really any other building like it in the world, at least as far as I know! So it really kind of sticks in the memory once you’ve seen it. And as such, it’s become, like, the main landmark of Shanghai. So um, yeah, that’s pretty much all there is to say!
 
Notes:
right in the middle - 在正中 (“right” emphasizes that it’s in the very middle)
I think it’s (probably) fair to say that – 我觉得可以说
the main focal point -主要的焦点
it’s lit up at night - 晚上亮起来
what else is there to say about it – 还有什么话可以说呢？
futuristic -未来派的
at least as far as I know – 至少据我所知是这样的
sticks in the memory – 清楚地留在记忆里
that’s pretty much all there is to say – 差不多没有别的话可说了！

I became really interested in baking last year when I started watching American TV series ‘Two Broke Girls’. The dream of this two girls is to own a large bakery, so they bake cupcakes for sale to earn more money. Because of this, I decided to learn baking, but I was still a rookie in baking, so I wanted to start it over. I searched the Internet for specific recipes. Thanks to the Internet, I could get easy access to the information I need. Since I’m only available on the weekends, I searched for the recipes every Friday evening and then made preparations, so I could start baking the next morning. The recipe I have learned this time, is how to make cupcakes. At first, I though baking the cupcakes was not that hard, but it turned out to be different. In order to make delicate and pretty fondant-covered cupcakes, I had to follow every step of the recipe strictly, especially pay attention to what we call ‘Baker’s percentage’, which means, the percentage of the flour, water and sugar should be strictly measured. In addition, I had to be careful of the heat of the oven and the baking time, or else the cupcakes would be overcooked. After taking the cupcakes out of the oven, I also need to decorate the cupcakes with some colourful chocolate beans. From the recipes, I learned that baking is also a type of skill that needs patience, chariness and initiative. Although the whole process sounds a little bit complex, it’s still quite interesting to learn how to do it. When you devote your time and your energy to something and the results turn out to be good, you will feel a sense of fulfillment.

### Answer
例文：
Weibo is a popular website for personal social network in China. I signed up my own account in 2009. It’s similar to twitter, users may create a personal profile, and then add other users as friends and exchange messages. People share their mood, record the things they do, or show their selfies to their friends or even some strangers. It is quite convenient for users to know what their friends are doing because of the function of automatic notifications when they update their profile. Many celebrities have signed up their accounts in Weibo, they sometimes update their recent selfies or report their recent schedule. Users can follow the people they are interested in in Weibo so that they can receive the recent information of their friends or some celebrities they like. Some users share some funny things or funny pictures and other users can comment on these things. Thus, some users become popular in Weibo although they’re just some normal people. I use Weibo almost every day because I don’t want to miss any piece of interesting news. In this way, I can also keep in touch with my friends and communicate with some strangers who have the same interests with me.

### Question

Describe an ambition you have not achieved yet.


You should say:


what it is;


when you first had this ambition;


why you had this ambition;


and explain why you haven't achieved it yet.

备考建议：如果把这个"理想夙愿"想的很大，说起来的难度自然不容易。但如果把它细化为一次搁浅的旅行，一门想去学但还没学会的外语，一所想去但没去成的学校，一种想读但遗憾错过的专业，一份想获得而没有得到的工作，就会变得具体而容易表达。

### Answer

I have a dream deep inside that one day I can travel around the world and visit all the fantastic places. I first had this ambition when I was at the first year of my college. I watched a documentary about the famous tourist attractions around the world. I learned from the documentary that the earth breeds the whole world population yet people know quite few about it. The documentary inspired me to see more about the world and learn it more deeply. From then on, I started to do something to achieve this ambition. The first and the most important thing I need to do is saving money. I have earned some money by doing part time jobs, but that’s way from enough, so I have to keep on making money. The second step is to make my travelling plans, including destinations, transportation and the cost. I have searched for many geographic books in our main library and learned some geographic knowledge in advance, which will be useful in planning my trip. Moreover, there will be less difficulties if I master a world language, which is the thing I’m doing now. Taking the IELTS is a good chance for me to practice my English and I’ve prepared a lot to get high scores. These are the three things I’ve done for my ambition. However, I can’t achieve my ambition now since I haven’t got enough money for that. But I will spend the rest of my life to make my dream come true.

### Answer
马来西亚

Last year I went to Hangzhou with my family on the weekend last month. It was a memorable trip and I was impressed by the marvelous natural sceneries in Hangzhou. Although I grew up in Shanghai, which is quite near to Hangzhou, I hadn’t got the chance to go there. It only took us two hours to get there by train. When I arrived at Hangzhou, I was immediately attracted by its majestic landscape. I had never seen this kind of scenery before. Hangzhou is also a big city but there are green mountains, clear water, and beautiful stones there. We went to the most famous tourist attractions such as the Westlake, Lingyin Temple and Xixi National Wetland Park. I like the Westlake the most. It looks like a big mirror located in the center of the city. It is really a fantastic lake. No wonder it has become the symbol of the city. I was so excited and I took a lot of pictures with my parents. We also enjoyed the special food which was different from what I had in Shanghai. It’s much more delicious here. We stayed there for only two days, but it was a memorable trip for me. The natural scenery in Hangzhou frees me from the burden of daily routine. I would like to go there again and breathe the fresh air there. 


## 48 想合作的家人
### Answer:

Describe a family member you would like to work with.
You should say:
Who this person is
What kind of person he or she is
Whether you’ve worked together before
And explain why you would like to work with this person
 
### Answer 
Ok right then, well after thinking for a bit just now, I’d say the family member I’d most like to work with is my younger brother, for reasons I’ll come to shortly.
 
But firstly, I’d like to tell you a little bit about him as a person, and I guess probably the best word to describe him would be sociable, because you know, he just loves being around people and making friends. And um.. what else?.... Um…yeah, I’d basically just describe him as being very outgoing, super friendly, and uh… extremely likeable. For example, I mean, he always seems to be in a good mood, and I guess it’s because he has a positive outlook on life. You know, he always sees the good side of things, and that’s kind of what makes him fun to be with.
 
So yeah, that’s basically his general personality, and in terms of why I’d like to work with him, well, simply speaking, I think we would complement each other quite well. Because um, firstly, he’s much more of a businessman than me. You know, I have no idea about how to run a company, whereas he studied business at university and has much more of a business mind than I do. So that’s one thing, and uh, secondly, I think he would be very good at making contacts and finding new clients, while I would be more suited to staying in the office and doing the nitty-gritty work for them, like writing reports and stuff.
 
So um, yeah, I think we would make a pretty good team, and although we haven’t worked together before in a business context, I think we understand each other well enough that we could succeed pretty well together.
 
 
Notes:
for reasons I’ll come to shortly            -           原因我待一会儿就解释
he has a positive outlook on life           -           他有积极的人生观

complement each other quite well         -           相互补充

nitty-gritty work                    -           细节工作
We would make a good team      -           We would work well as a team

### Answer 1
To start with, I want to say something about Mini Cooper, which is the vehicle(imported product,点题) I want to talk about.
 
It has a stream lined design
it's very petrol/fuel efficient, cos the price of gasoline keeps increasing highly these days.
take safety into consideration, the car should have 4 airbags so the chance you get injured in accident is lower.
It would be advisable id the car has global positioning system, i would not get lost when exploring new places
The car should have enough space so i can take whole family to countryside for a picnic or sth on holiday or weekend.
 
key words:
loads space in the back (后排空间大)
a couple of nice gadgets 一些很好的设备
such as: sat-nav reversing cam (倒车影像)
         decent audio system (音响效果好)
         automatic air conditioning (自动空调)
        digital dashboard (仪表盘)
It rides nicely, it's well drived (好开)
very strong horse power(马力强劲)

### Answer 2
If you ask me what kind of vehicle I’d like to own, I would say it would be a red Mini Cooper. It has been my dream car since I saw the movie “The Italian Job” two year ago, in which Mini Cooper is the biggest star.Certainly I would say that both the classical elegance of design and fashionable but nostalgic style fascinated me deeply. I would want a red one because it’s just trendy and stylish for girls. In addition to this, safety is the most important thing; I want my mini to have at least 4 air bags. I also intend to listen to music while I am driving, so an excellent stereo system is crucial for me. What I’d like to say next is  that„sunroof, yes; it would be a remarkable configuration.A Mini Cooper would definitely affect my life in many ways. Possessing a vehicle would give a much greater degree of mobility, enabling me to move around freely. I would be no longer forced to rely on public transport. In addition to this, travelling by my mini is much more comfortable. I could adjust the heating in winter and the air conditioning in summer to suit my own needs and preference. With the construction of good fast motorways, long distances can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. I could enjoy my leisure time to the full by making trips to the suburbs at the weekends. This feeling of independence, and the freedom to go where I please, is one of the reasons why I would like to own a Mini. More importantly, it’s a BMW, which earns its name by the safety performance. Together with its exquisite and classical looks, that’s why I would want a Mini Cooper.

## 50 想重温的电影  

### Question：
Describe a movie you would like to watch again. You should say: 
what it was about;  when and where you watched it; who you watched it with;  and explain why you would like to watch it again.

### Answer

The movie I would like to watch again is an Italian movie called ‘Life is Beautiful’. I watched it with my sister in her dormitory three years ago. My sister downloaded this film from the internet and she told me it was a wonderful movie. At first, I thought it was a comedy since the hero was funny and how he chased his wife was full of surprise and joyfulness. But it turned out to be a tragedy. The man was a Jewish and during the war world two, he and his boy was prisoned by the Nazis. His little boy didn’t know what happened and the man lied to him that it was just a game. They had to finish every task and behave themselves so that they could gain points to win the game. At the end of the movie, the man was killed by the Nazis for protecting his son. His son thought they won the game and got a tank for prize. But after he grew up, he came to know the truth. I wanted to watch it again because I was deeply touched by the love of the great father for his son. He created a beautiful world for his son and protected his son’s innocence even at the last minute of his life. 

### Answer 2

Speaking of a film I want to watch again and again. Well, it is definitely Léon: The Professional. It’s an English-language French action crime thrill film. 
Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.
Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon’s neighbour. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.

When Mathilda’s family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon’s true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.
I first watch it seven years ago when one of my best friends recommended it to me with the enticing comment: With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together.
This film was absolutely amazing. I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed. It’s not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great (although they are well done...), but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon’s door. It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman’s face, symbolizing something angelic. And the moment has so much more meaning.

### Sample Answer 3

自己想可以是iPhone, house, Macbook

All of my friends know that reading is my biggest interest, especially something about literature. If I have free time, I would like to go to the libraries or book shops to do some free reading. Therefore, if you ask me to say something I want to buy in the future, I would like to say a book in original English. When it comes to the content of the book, it is the last part of a serial story which includes ups and downs of plot. I cannot help to reading three books in two weeks round the clock. What is more, I dreamt of the plot I read and I really want to pursue the end of the story. Unfortunately the last book won’t be published in China until next year. Because of my high-level requirement, I don’t trust the private translation I have already got. The perfect use of graphics is another factor that attracts me. So finally I decide to buy an original book abroad. The price of the book is over 500RMB which can cover half of my monthly living expenses. I make up my mind to save whatever I can save to buy that book, such as cutting the budget of buying new clothes and shoes, and eating extra food. It would be nice to have the book in my hand, and I will dream of happy laughter. I have realized that because it is in the original edition, I may have difficulties understanding some words or phrases. And I determine to overcome this barrier by looking up the dictionary. Of course, I will regard it as my treasure coz it doesn’t come easy.

没想好怎么答（可以直接说Option,  也可以说在Nero换组的事情）

The truth sometimes hurts, especially for the one loved you. Recently, I had a bad time with my girlfriend cuz I concealed something I did secretly from her and she found out lately. I went to visit my ex-girl friend’s grave without telling her and I found an excuse to escaped from a day that we ‘re supposed to stay together. I know she will be unhappy about this thing, but you know I have to do that. Early this April which is the season of Chinese Qing Ming festival, the grave visiting days. I was feeling bad. Sleepless and restless, feeling like something cast a shadow over me. Sometime I even felt a bit diluted, sinking in the miserable memory with my ex-girlfriend and certain kind of depression. I’ve been searching for some freedom in my mind so I think since it’s the Qing Ming, I have to pay her a visit to honor her and I regarded this as a closure which will give me the inner peace. Since I came back from the grave yard, I feel much relieved and finally put myself together. I thought it was just a white lie and it was for the good sake of our long-term relationship. But after week she found out the message that indicates I’ve been to the grave yard with my ex-girlfriend’s family. She was so furious at me, saying I shouldn’t have concealed the truth from her and that was lack of mutual trust. It took me almost a whole week to calm her down and let her know I didn’t mean to hurt her. Until now I still feel regretful about this, it became something we can’t get over now. If I had told her the truth, I think her would let me do, although she will feel a bit sad about this but it still won’t jeopardized our relationship. But now what was done is done, the only thing I can do is to treat her better and help her to forgive and forget.

## 53 有领导力的朋友
### QuestionA friend who you think is a good leader1. Who this friend is2. How you first met3. How other people behave towards him or herExplain why you think he or she is a good leader### AnswerA friend of mine who is a good leader is Terry.  He is about 30 years old. We are colleagues, but we work in different departments and different locations. So we had not met each other until both of us participated a training course in our company last year. At that time, we were in the same study group on that course. You know, to work together on some discussion and projects. He was volunteered to be the leader of our group. Ever since, he has been managing the affairs of our group, like organizing the meetings, involving all members in the discussion and pushing us to reach agreement. Instead of being an aggressive leader that everyone complaints about, he was gentle, polite and thoughtful.  All of team members admired and respected him because of his good qualities and his wisdom. For example, he didn’t talk much, but what he said always caught the key points of the problem. He would give us research directions when we didn’t even have a single clue. He was good at solving the disagreements between team members without hurting anyone’s feeling. I think he is a good leader because he made the whole team together to achieve the same goal during the training course, which is definitely not an easy job.
