# 新题准备

## 1 喜欢乘飞机的人

我有个高中时候的女同学叫做Shelly, 据我所知她现在非常喜欢坐飞机旅行。有趣的是，她从清华大学毕业后在交通部工作，所以，我猜想，她喜欢坐飞机旅行是因为她非常清楚在各种交通方式中哪种更适合她，她也谈到过坐飞机其实非常安全，仅有的不方便就是需要在机场等待，但是她已经很有经验来控制提前到达机场的时间。她经常去国内各个城市出差，偶尔也会去马来西亚、新加坡旅游；有的时候，航空公司还会给她赠送机票，因为她累计的里程非常多。我想，我认识的人中她是最喜欢乘坐飞机的人了。

I have a high school female students named Shelly, as far as I know she is very fond of traveling by air. Interestingly, after she graduated from Qinghua University in the Department of Transportation to work, so, I guess, she likes to travel by plane because she was very clear in various transportation modes which is more suitable for her, she also talked about the fact the plane very safe, only inconvenience is the need to wait at the airport, but she has a lot of experience to control the advance arrival time at the airport. She often went to various cities in the country on a business trip, and occasionally go to Malaysia, Singapore Tourism; sometimes, airline tickets will give her gift as she accumulated mileage very much. I think, people I know, she is a favorite of people flying.

## 4 等待

生小孩

分娩也可以用delivery

As a father, I would like to talk about my waiting for my baby's birth in 25th, April 2012. My wife needs to do a c-section (剖腹产或者 caesarean，建议用c-section) as there was something wrong with her womb (wu:m). So I was still very nervous although the operation was arranged in the best hospital in Hangzhou. And of course, I was very excited and I could't wait to see my baby alouthgh I didn't know the baby's gender. The c-section started from about 2:30 pm and it was really a long wait for me. My mother in law and I waited outside the 
operation room and I couldn't sit down at all. I was walking up and down. I was excited because I was going to be a father. I'm very nervous and worried becasue my wife was some kind of high risk delivery women. Thanks God. My wife and daughter were pull outside the operation room at 4:09, lying on the bed and both healthy. It was really interesting and important experience for me and I was really very happy to wait at that time alghough I am not patient at all. And now I am waiting for my baby girl's grown up and in my opinion, it is another long and happy waiting. I really enjoy it.

## 9 成功

升为SA的答辩

关于成功，我想起了在2012年下半年成功得到系统架构师职位的事情。在2012年的时候，我已经作为高级工程师在Nero杭州分公司工作了好几年了，然后由于公司的结构调整，原有的德国架构师离职了，我有机会得到这个职位。但是由于这个职位比较重要，所以我需要通过一个由公司的技术专家们组织的一个答辩。我的主管给了我这个机会，我也在答辩过程中充分展示了自己的技术能力以及自己过往的工作贡献，尽管PPT做得不是特别漂亮，而且部分关于技术架构的问题回答得不是特别好，但我还是顺利得到了这个职位，从而承担起项目的架构职责。我当然对于这次成功感到非常开心。但是非常不幸的是，接下来几年由于公司另外一个重要产品的失败，公司整体的情况不景气，发展越来越糟糕，为了我自己的发展，我也在2014年离开了公司；所以，很遗憾，没有在这个重要的职位上发挥更多的作用。但这次成功还是给自己的简历加分不少

About success, I think in the second half of 2012 successfully get the system architect job to do. In 2012, when I had as a senior engineer at the Hangzhou branch of Nero for several years, and due to the corporate restructuring, the original architect of the German left, I had the opportunity to get this job. However, because this position is more important, so I need to pass a by the company's technical experts organized a reply. My supervisor gave me this opportunity, I also reply process demonstrating their technical ability and their own past work contribution, although PPT do not particularly pretty, and some questions about the technical architecture of the answer was not particularly good, but I successfully got the position, which assume responsibility for infrastructure projects. Of course I am very happy for this success. But very unfortunately, the next few years due to the failure of an important company additional products, the company's overall situation downturn, the development is getting worse, for my own development, I also left the company in 2014; therefore, it is Unfortunately, it did not play a greater role in this important post. But this success or to their resumes lot of extra points

## 12 广告
我想谈论的是一家主要做羊毛衫的商家在电视上做的广告，它的名字叫做恒源祥；最后一个字和汉字的羊其实很像。我很小的时候，也许还在读小学的时候，就从电视上见过他们的广告。我觉得他们的广告还是很简洁,很有特色,很容易让人们记住的，就是一个小羊出来，然后用很可爱的声音念出商家的名字，然后后面加上三个羊字。但是，让人没想到的是，在2008年的时候，这个广告升级了。你知道，羊是中国的12生肖之一，于是这个新广告将同样的广告词重复了12遍，仅仅是将后面的羊换成了其他的生肖比如虎或者龙之类的。我和我的小伙伴看到这个广告都惊呆了，这应该是我人生中见到的最难忘的广告了。但是坦白说，我相当不喜欢甚至是讨厌这个升级后的广告，虽然这能让人更好的记住，但是却毫无意义。

I want to talk about is a major business do sweater do advertising on television, it's name is Heng Yuan Xiang; the last word and the characters actually like sheep. I was very young, maybe still in elementary school, have seen their ads on TV. I think their advertising is very simple, very unique, very easy for people to remember, is a lamb out, and then a very lovely voice read out the merchant's name, and then followed by three sheep word. However, people did not expect that, in 2008, when the advertising upgrade. You know, the sheep is one of China's 12 animals, so the new ad will be the same ad repeated 12 times, just to the back of the sheep into the other zodiac such as Tiger or the Dragon class. Me and my little friends are shocked to see this ad, this should be seen in my life the most memorable ads. But frankly, I do not like or even hate rather upgraded this ad, although it can make people better remember, but meaningless.

## 14 工作优秀的人

可以结合以前的主题“有领导力的朋友”一起说。我想，还是说张立峰比较合适；比说Leon合适。

在我参加工作之后，我遇到过很多工作优秀的人，其中一个就是我今天想要讨论的人叫做张立峰，是我刚参加工作时的导师，同时也是我小组的leader。他比我大5岁，是一位杰出的软件工程师。首先，他的技术能力非常好，熟练掌握工作所需要的技能；然后，他非常善于解决分析问题，debug的能力和fix issues的能力很好，而且很善于总结经验；其次，我觉得他是一个非常友善的人，乐于帮助别人，尤其是指导刚刚参加工作的菜鸟，我觉得这也体现了他的领导才能。最后，学习能力也是非常重要的。因为在我们这行，技术发展太快；据我所知，他现在在一家创业公司从事着移动开发工作，这是他之前没有接触过的，但是他也做得非常好。


After my work, I have met a lot of work outstanding, of which one is the person I want to discuss today is called Zhang Lifeng, a mentor when I first job, but also the leader of my team. He is five years older than me, was an outstanding software engineers. First, his technical ability is very good, master the skills needed for the work; then, he was very good at solving analysis problems, the ability to debug capabilities and fix issues of good and very good at summing up experience; secondly, I think he is a very friendly people, willing to help others, especially novice guide just participated in the work, I think it also reflects his leadership. Finally, learning ability is also very important. Because in our line, technology is developing too fast; as far as I know, he is now engaged in a startup mobile development work, which he previously had contact, but he is also doing very well.

## 21 借东西

老实说，我很少向别人借东西，而且我也不太喜欢找别人借东西。不过就在上个月，我找我太太的妹妹借了一个笔记本。事情是这样的，我和我太太各有一个笔记本，然后我9月底需要到武汉去参加公司的校园招聘，非常不凑巧的是，其中一个笔记本由于长期不用，不知道为什么显示屏坏掉了，而另一台笔记本我太太工作中需要；不得已，我只能找我太太的妹妹借了一个快要被淘汰的笔记本，那台笔记本的性能比较糟糕，好在我只需要用来浏览网页，登陆公司的招聘系统，不需要额外做开发的工作，所以这个笔记本还是可以胜任的。当然，我用这个笔记本顺利的完成了自己的招聘工作。

To be honest, I rarely borrow something from others, but I also do not like to find someone to borrow things. Just last month, however, I find my wife's sister borrowed a notebook. The way it is, my wife and I each have a laptop, then I need to go to Wuhan by the end of September to participate in the company's campus recruitment, it is not coincidentally, one of the notebook due to the long-term need, I do not know why the screen is broken, and another laptop my wife needed to work; a last resort, I can only find my wife's sister borrowed a notebook is about to be eliminated, and that the laptop's relatively poor performance, but fortunately I just need to browse the web, visit the company's recruitment system, no additional development work to do, so this notebook is capable of. Of course, I use this notebook successfully completed their recruitment.

## 31 一首歌

You'll never walk alone


Frankly / Honestly, I am not good at music  

老实说，我并不擅长音乐，而且我也不经常听歌。但确实有那么一首歌对我来说有点特别。这首歌名字叫做“You will never walk alone”，是利物浦足球俱乐部的队歌，而我正是利物浦俱乐部的忠实球迷。我第一次听这首歌是在2001年，那年利物浦俱乐部拿了5个冠军，是一个非常受欢迎的球队，那个时候我喜欢上了这只球队。我表哥和我说，你听过这个球队的队歌吗？于是我在他的推荐之下第一次听了这首歌并且喜欢上了这首歌。首先，它的旋律非常优美；然后它有很悠久的历史，我记得，披头士乐队也曾经演唱过这首歌。最重要的是，我觉得它表达了一个积极向上的精神。人生就像一段旅程；我们会遇到各种困难，各种风雨，但是我们遇到困难的时候不应该放弃，要记住，我们不是在独行，我们要勇敢前行，我们的朋友、家人会一直陪伴我们穿过暴风雨最终看到金色的天空，正如歌词中所唱到的那样。

Honestly, I'm not good at music, and I do not often listen to music. But it does have a song for me, a little bit special. This song name is "You will never walk alone", it is Liverpool Football Club team song, and I is the loyal fans of Liverpool Football Club. I first heard this song in 2001, it took five years Liverpool club champion, is a very popular team, at that time I liked this team. My cousin and I said, you've heard of this team team song? So the first time I heard this song under his recommendation and in love with this song. First, it is very beautiful melody; then it has a very long history, I remember, the Beatles had also sung this song. Most importantly, I think it expresses a positive spirit. Life is like a journey; we will encounter various difficulties, all kinds of wind and rain, but when we encounter difficulties should not give up, keep in mind that we are not alone, we want to brave the front lines, our friends and family will be has been with us through the storm finally see the golden sky, as the lyrics as sung.

## 36 想去还未去的国家

如果将来有机会，我非常希望能够去英国旅行。英国是欧洲的一个发达国家，非常漂亮的岛国；无论是城市还是自然风光都非常值得赞赏；城市建设很好，自然风光也很漂亮；既可以享受海景，也可以享受苏格兰高地的自然风光，而且历史也非常悠久。我可以去伦敦参观美丽而又富有历史气息的城市，去看看大本钟，看看泰晤士河；也可以去参观苏格兰的城堡。当然，我之所以想去英国，主要是因为我是利物浦的球迷，我非常想去利物浦市的安菲尔德球场看一场伟大的足球比赛；同时，去感受一些利物浦市的夜景也是非常不错的主意。要知道，利物浦市曾经是英格兰的第二大港口城市，还是2008年欧洲文化之都，也很多可以欣赏的地方。对了，利物浦市还是披头士的故乡呢，尽管我对音乐并不是那么感兴趣。

If you will have the opportunity, I hope to be able to travel to England. The UK is a developed country in Europe, a very beautiful island; whether urban or natural landscape is very commendable; urban construction is very good, very beautiful natural scenery; can enjoy the sea view, you can also enjoy the natural scenery of the Scottish Highlands, and a very long history. I can go to London to visit the beautiful and historic atmosphere of the city, to see Big Ben, take a look at the Thames; also can visit the Scottish castle. Of course, the reason I want to go to the UK, mainly because I was the Liverpool fans, I really want to go to Anfield Liverpool City watching a great football game; at the same time, to feel some of the night the city of Liverpool is also a very good idea . You know, the city of Liverpool was once England's second largest port city, was the 2008 European Capital of Culture, there are many places you can enjoy. Yes, the Beatles' hometown of Liverpool city still does, even though I am not so interested in music.

## 38 忘记的重要事情：

我曾经非常为我的记忆力和细心而自豪。不过，随着年龄的增长，长期的加班与使用电脑，我必须承认，我的记忆力下降得很快。比如，在今年6月初的时候，我就忘记还我的信用卡了。我本应该在每个月的5号来还信用卡，以前我大概会在3号就会还掉。但是那个月我正好要加班工作，同时我也在寻找新的工作机会，所以尽管我安装了一些移动应用来提醒我还款，我还是非常不幸的忘记了这件事情。在6号的时候，我的太太提醒了我，我才想起来。我当时非常担心，因为我曾经听说，如果忘记还了信用卡，需要支付全额的高昂的罚息，同时对自己的信用记录有影响。不过幸运的是，我打电话给银行的工作人员，他们告诉我说，会有两天的缓冲期的。于是，我赶紧还清了信用卡，总算是没有造成额外的不良影响。

I was very attentive to my memory and proud. However, with age, overtime and long-term use of computers, I must admit that my memory decline rapidly. For example, in early June, I forgot my credit card still up. I should have come on the 5th of each month also credit cards, before I probably would have lost in the 3rd. But that month, I just want to work overtime, at the same time I am also looking for new jobs, so even though I installed some mobile payment application to remind me, I was very unfortunate to forget this thing. No. 6, my wife reminds me, I think of it. I was very worried because I had heard that if you forget also a credit card, you need to pay the full amount of the high penalty, while the impact on their credit record. But fortunately, I called the bank staff, they told me that there will be a grace period of two days. So, I quickly pay off the credit card, and finally did not result in additional adverse effects.

## 43 有关健康的文章 

You should say:

What is tha article about healthy life

where

How felt

why love

我一年前在知乎网上看到一篇讲健康的文章，它的主题是如何改善睡眠。

我觉得这篇文章讲得非常好，它首先介绍了睡眠质量对于身体健康的重要性；然后描述了通常睡眠质量不好的现象；接着分析了睡眠质量不好的原因，最后给出了一些有效的建议来改善睡眠。我喜欢这篇文章是因为我的睡眠质量真的非常糟糕；我现在尝试着按照这篇文章的建议改善我的睡眠，现在已经有了一些效果；虽然我的睡眠还不是足够好，但至少即使我加班到很晚，我也还可以拥有一个过得去的睡眠，不至于在每天早晨醒来的时候觉得头痛。当然，我还需要按照上面的建议继续放松自己，减轻自己的心理压力来获得更好的睡眠从而拥有更健康的身体。


I think this article speaks very well, which first introduced the importance of sleep quality health; then describe the generally poor quality of sleep phenomenon; then analyzes the reasons for the poor quality of sleep. Finally, some effective the suggestions to improve sleep. I like this article because my sleep quality is really very bad; I'm trying to improve my sleep accordance with the recommendations of this article, has now had some effect; although my sleep was not good enough, but at least even I work late, I also can have a decent night's sleep, not to wake up every morning in time feel a headache. Of course, I also need to follow the above recommendations to continue to relax, reduce their psychological pressure to get a better night's sleep and thus have a more healthy body.

## 46 噪音

在古荡时的狗叫
2013年我住在古荡小区的时候，早上经常可以听到狗叫的声音。你知道吗，那可是在早上7电哦，那个时候大多数人都还在睡觉呢。而且应该是很大的狗叫得很响的声音。我一般在那个时候都还没起床，而且，我的小宝宝也需要睡觉啊。刚开始几天，有噪音的时候，我只是忽略了，因为我猜想这只是偶尔才会发生的事情吧。可是这个噪音持续了好几天，于是我下去寻找了一下，这才发现原来是一条非常大的狗，它的主人并不在家。我和狗主人谈了噪音的事情，可是她非常不礼貌，不讲道理；我非常生气，准备像政府部门投诉。不过还没等到我打电话呢，当天晚上我就听说相关部门过来解决这个问题了，我猜想是有别的邻居投诉了吧！谢天谢地，我现在的小区里倒没有发生类似的事情。

2013 I live in Gudang cell when the morning can often hear the sound of dogs barking. You know, that's at 7:00 electric Oh, at that time most people are still sleeping. And it should be a lot of barking very loud voice. I usually get up at that time have not, moreover, my little baby need to sleep ah. Just started a few days, when there is noise, I just ignored it because I guess things happen only occasionally now. But this noise lasted for several days, so I go looking for a bit and discovered that the original is a very large dog, its owner was not at home. My dog owners talked about the noise thing, but she was very rude, unreasonable; I am very angry, like government departments to prepare a complaint. But even before I called it that evening I heard over the relevant departments to solve this problem, and I guess there are other neighbors complained it! Thankfully, I am now in the area pour something similar does not happen.


## 47 长时间相处的家人

一定要是the most time with吗？我觉得还是直接说小孩吧

坦白说，自从我上高中开始，我就很少和家人在一起，因为我需要去外地上学，每个月才回家一次。至于现在，我花最多时间陪伴的当然是我三岁的宝贝女儿了。我愿意和她一起做任何事情，包括给她讲故事啦，陪她玩一些幼稚的游戏啦，陪她说话，陪她看动画片，甚至让她陪我看足球比赛。工作日的时候我工作比较忙，所以只能晚上陪她。我周末的所有时间几乎都是在陪她，我觉得这样也很有意思，我很享受和她一起的时光，尽管某些游戏实在是太幼稚了。我觉得，作为一个父亲而言，尽管工作很忙，我还是应该多陪伴她，让她感觉到家庭的温暖。否则，她作为一个独生子女，会太寂寞了，陪伴她会对她的成长有好处，让她有个美好的童年。

Frankly, since I started high school, I rarely with my family, because I need to go to the field school, only to go home once a month. For now, I spend the most time with, of course, my three year old baby girl. I would like her to do anything together, including her storytelling friends, to accompany her friends to play some childish game, to accompany her, to accompany her to watch cartoons, and even let her accompany me to watch football matches. Days when I work busy, so only with her at night. Almost all of my time on weekends are with her, I think this is very interesting, I enjoyed time with her, even though some of the game is too naive. I think, as a father, despite busy work, I should spend more time with her, let her feel the warmth of the family. Otherwise, she was as a child, will be lonely, she would accompany her growth is good, so she had a wonderful childhood.

## 48 长时间步行

瑞士那次

2012年我和几位同事去德国出差，然后在一个阳光明媚的周末，我们自驾来到了瑞士，在阿尔卑斯山脚下一个叫做因特拉肯的小镇游玩。而其中一个重要的项目就是在阿尔卑斯山上徒步。我们先是在山顶游玩并且吃了午饭，然后乘坐缆车到半山腰；然后从半山腰一起往下徒步。这是最美好最伟大的徒步路线之一，虽然是山路，但是非常平坦；最重要的是，周围就是阿尔卑斯山的美景，我们边走边看着周围的雪山，看到白雪和植被的分割线，还看到了插着瑞士国旗的一些民间建筑。那天的天气也非常非常好，不热也不冷，微风吹得非常舒服，阳光照在身上暖暖的。虽然我们最终步行了将近三个小时才到达我们停车的地方，但是我们一点都不觉得累，而是非常享受。这是我人生中最美好的旅行之一，要知道，出国旅行并且在美丽的阿尔卑斯山徒步可是非常难得的。

2012 I and several colleagues went to Germany on a business trip, and then on a sunny weekend, we arrived by car in Switzerland, at the foot of the Alps in Interlaken town called play. And one of the important projects is in the Alps on foot. We first play at the top and ate lunch, and then take the cable car to the hillside; then walk together down from the hillside. This is one of the most beautiful hiking trails of the greatest, although the mountain, but very flat; most importantly, is surrounded by the Alps, we walked around looking at the snow-capped mountains to see snow and vegetation of the dividing line, Also see the Swiss flag stuck some folk architecture. The weather is also very, very good, it is not hot nor cold, very comfortable breeze blowing, the sun shines on the body warm. Although we eventually walk nearly three hours to get to our parking place, but we do not feel tired, but very enjoyable. This is one of the best trips of my life, you know, to travel abroad and in the beautiful Alps on foot are very rare.

## 49 长途自驾游

瑞士那次

2012年四月我和几位同事去德国出差，然后在一个阳光明媚的周末，我们自驾来到了瑞士，在阿尔卑斯山脚下一个叫做因特拉肯的小镇游玩。在那之前，我还没去过国外旅行。之前，我们考虑过乘坐火车去瑞士旅行，不过其中一个同事说，四个人一起开车去会更方便快捷。而且，从公司租借车非常方便，不需要额外的费用，算下来也更便宜一些，所以我们就租了一辆奔驰车。当然，其中有同事有驾照并且有自驾到奥地利的经历，也是我们坐车过去的原因之一。我们一路从德国的卡尔斯鲁尔开车到了因特拉肯，中间经过了苏黎世和卢塞恩吧，我们一直沿着阿尔卑斯山开，沿路可以充分领略山景。而到达因特拉肯的第二天，我们还开车到山脚下，因为我们要通过缆车上山。我很享受这个旅行，当然，那个开车的哥们会觉得稍微有点累吧！

April 2012 I and several colleagues went to Germany on a business trip, and then on a sunny weekend, we arrived by car in Switzerland, at the foot of the Alps in Interlaken town called play. Before that, I have not been traveling abroad. Before, we considered travel by train to Switzerland, but one of my colleagues said, four men drove together to be more convenient. Moreover, from the company leased car is very easy to use, no additional cost, doing also cheaper, so we rented a Mercedes car. Of course, some colleagues have a driver's license and have a car to go through Austria, it is one of the reasons we ride past. We drove all the way from Germany's Karlsruhe to Interlaken, in the middle of it after the Zurich and Lucerne, we have been open along the Alps, along the road can fully enjoy the mountain views. Interlaken to reach the next day, we drove to the foot of the hill, because we want to pass the cable car up the mountain. I really enjoyed this trip, of course, that drove the man will feel a little bit tired of it!

## 50 重要谈话

读高中的谈话吧！

我想谈论的是在我从初中升到高中时，我的初中班主任找我和我父亲谈的话，那应该是发生在十几年前了吧。那个时候我成绩很不错，可以去县城最好的高中读书，但是家里很穷，上高中需要一大笔学费，当时不一定能够负担得起，何况我还有一个妹妹要读书。有一个私立的学校邀请我去他们学校读书，承诺免除学费，我父亲动心了。我之前的班主任得到这个消息后，过来劝我爸爸不要为了一点学费就让我去差一些的学校。最好，在他的劝说下，我还是去了最好的高中。我想，如果我去了那所私立的学校，可能会因为没有足够的竞争而考不上好大学，也没办法认识那么多优秀可爱的同学，也许，人生轨迹就会完全不一样了。

I want to talk about that when I rose from junior high school, my junior high school teacher and my father talk to me, then it should happen in ten years ago now. At that time my grades were very good, you can go to the county of the best high school, but the family was poor, need a lot of high school tuition, was not always able to afford, not to mention I have a younger sister to school. There is a private school invited me to go to their school, commitment free tuition, my father relented. I get this message before homeroom, came to persuade my father not to let me go a little worse tuition schools. Preferably, at his persuasion, I went to the best school. I think that if I went to private school, may be because there is not enough competition and not get into a good university, there is no way to know so many good students cute, perhaps, life will be completely different trajectory.

## 11 家庭照片 (Done)(保留)A picture or photograph in your family1. What is in the picture2. Where this picture is in your home3. How this picture was taken4. Explain why you think this picture is meaningful
A photo in my family is a picture placed on my bedside table with a beautiful frame. It is a picture of my wife, Cindy, who is on a boat and is surrounded by several wild monkeys. And one of the monkeys is taking food from her hand. You should see her face in the picture. She is so afraid of being attacked by those monkeys that she sits straightly and is too nervous to move. I took this picture when we had a boat trip in a rainforest in Malaysia last year. The guide stopped the boat in the river, where many wild monkeys stayed on the both sides of the river. As soon as my wife took out the food, the monkeys swam through the river and climbed onto our boat. They were not afraid of us at all, just took the food from our hands and bags. So I pushed the shutter and took that picture. It is meaningful to us because I guess it was the 1st time that Cindy has a close contact with so many wild animals. The other important reason is that it is really a good memory of our first overseas tourism.
